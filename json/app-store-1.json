    "title": "Business Models and Monetization - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/business-models/",
    "html": "Choosing a business model\n\nThe App Store empowers you to scale your app distribution worldwide using a variety of business models. The right business model for your app balances your goals with your target market’s expectations. Choosing your business model before developing your app can inform your app design decisions for a cohesive user experience.\n\nFreeFreemiumPaidPaymium\nFree\n\nWith free models, users don’t pay to download or use your app. Removing the barrier of price increases the likelihood that users in your target market will download and try your app, which can help increase awareness and expand your user base. If you’re looking to grow your brand or attract a large user base, consider offering your app for free.\n\nFree without monetization. Your app doesn’t offer in-app purchases or the ability to buy physical goods or services within the app, and doesn’t display advertisements. You don’t earn any revenue from your app.\n\nFree with physical goods and services. Users can purchase physical goods and services — such as clothing or food — within your app or order rides from transportation services. You earn revenue from these sales.\n\nFree with display advertising. Display advertisements are part of the app experience and you earn revenue when presenting them. Make sure that all display advertisements in your app are appropriate and relevant to your target market, as low-quality, obtrusive, or inappropriate advertising reduces engagement and retention.\n\nYour app and any third-party SDKs you use to help target display advertising or measure advertising efficacy need to follow the Data Use and Sharing and the Advertising sections of the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nReader. Users purchase or subscribe to content — such as magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video — outside of your app and enjoy access to that content within your app. You generate revenue outside of the app. For more information, see the “Reader” Apps section of the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nFreemium\n\nWith freemium models, users pay nothing to download your app and are offered optional in-app purchases for premium features, additional content, subscriptions, or digital goods. Freemium apps are accessible to all users, regardless of whether or not they choose to spend, and offer the option to pay to enhance or customize the experience. You earn revenue from the sales of in-app purchases within your app. Successful freemium apps operate as services that are continually updated to attract and retain users. You can offer multiple types of in-app purchases, including subscriptions.\n\nIn-app purchase types\n\nConsumable. Users can purchase different types of consumables, such as lives or gems in a game, to further their progress through an app. Consumable in-app purchases are depleted as they’re used, and can be purchased again.\n\nNon-consumable. Users can purchase non-consumable, premium features within an app. Non-consumables are purchased once and do not expire, such as additional filters in a photo app. Apple can host content associated with your non-consumable in-app purchases.\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions. Users can purchase access to services or periodically updated content, such as monthly access to cloud storage or a weekly subscription to a magazine. Users are charged on a recurring basis until they decide to cancel. Learn more about subscriptions.\n\nNon-renewing subscriptions. Users can purchase access to services or content for a limited duration, such as a season pass to streaming content. This type of subscription does not renew automatically, so users need to renew each time.\n\nIf you wish, you can allow users to access content or services across multiple Apple devices, as well as other platforms. If you offer any multiplatform functionality, be sure any purchasable items or services outside of the app are also available as in-app purchases within your app. For more information, see the Multiplatform Services section of the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nLearn about different freemium experiences\n\nPaid\n\nIn the paid model, users pay once to download your app and use all of its functionality. There are no additional charges or in-app purchases. You earn revenue from the sales of your app. This model resonates with users who prefer to pay once to get the full experience. Because the cost to download might make users consider the app’s value more carefully, successful paid apps are often positioned as premium experiences through outstanding design, functionality, and marketing.\n\nPaymium\n\nIn this combination of the paid and freemium models, users pay to download your app and have the option to buy additional features, content, or services through in-app purchases if they want to engage more deeply. It offers the possibility of lowering the app’s download price while using in-app purchases for ongoing monetization. Successful paymium apps offer premium design, functionality, and content, as well as advanced features intended to complement the experience.\n\nAs with paid apps, the cost to download might make users consider the app’s value more carefully. Set expectations about what users get when they pay up front and what they’ll get if they purchase optional enhancements. Keep in mind that creating in-app purchases for features that are required to use the app can cause a negative experience and may affect your sales and retention.\n\nApp Store Small Business Program\n\nThe App Store Small Business Program is designed to accelerate innovation and help propel your small business forward with the next generation of groundbreaking apps on the App Store. It features a reduced commission rate of 15% on paid apps and in-app purchases, so you can invest more resources into your business to continue building quality apps that customers love.\n\nLearn about the program"

    "title": "Building Apps for Kids - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/kids-apps/",
    "html": "Building Apps for Kids\n\nYou can help kids learn, grow, and have fun with games, interactive stories, educational materials, and more. Find out how to create kids’ apps that are safe and trusted by parents.\n\nThe Kids Category\n\nThe Kids category on the App Store is a great way for people to easily find apps specifically designed for children ages 11 and under on iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. You’ll place your app in one of three age bands based on its primary audience: 5 and under, 6 to 8, or 9 to 11. In addition, you’ll need to follow certain guidelines to ensure user safety.\n\nWhen parents visit the Kids category, they expect the apps they find will provide only age-appropriate content and protect their children’s data, as well as require a parental gate in order to link out of the app, request permissions, or present purchasing opportunities. Apps in this category should not transmit personally identifiable information or device information to third parties, even in sections of the app that are meant for parents or other adults. In addition, advertisements must be human-reviewed for age appropriateness in order to be displayed.\n\nRead the App Store Review Guidelines for details and carefully review relevant laws and regulations around child privacy.\n\nView App Store review guideline 1.3\n\nView App Store review guideline 5.1.4\n\nParental Gates\n\nA parental gate presents an adult-level task that must be completed in order to continue. The App Store Review Guidelines require apps in the Kids category to use parental gates to prevent kids from engaging in commerce or following links out of an app to websites, social networks, or other apps without the knowledge of their parent or guardian. A good strategy is to randomize the combination of questions and answers each time the gate is presented to prevent kids from memorizing the responses, and below are a few examples to provide inspiration. Please note that the parental gate requirement for the Kid’s category is generally not the same as securing parental consent to collect personal data from children.\n\nReading Simple Instructions\n\nSome parental gates include simple instructions that describe a specific task or a combination of interactions for an adult to complete in order to engage in commerce or link out of the app.\n\nSpeaking Simple Instructions\n\nIf your app is intended for pre-literate children, consider using a voice over prompt to help kids know that they need to involve their parent.\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\nYou can also require users to correctly answer questions in order to continue. The question should be age-appropriate or customizable by the parent, so the child cannot easily answer it.\n\nDistributing in Volume\n\nAll apps on the App Store are automatically available for volume purchase for the same price in Apple School Manager, where educational institutions download apps for volume distribution. Alternatively, you can can choose to provide your app for 50% of its listed price for educational institutions purchasing quantities of 20 or more.\n\nLearn more"

    "title": "Freemium Games - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/freemium-games/",
    "html": "Freemium Games\n\nFreemium games allow players to download and play your game at no cost while offering optional in-app purchases to supplement their experience. Successful freemium games provide a great experience for both paying and nonpaying players, and are actively maintained in order to sustain engagement. Learn about distributing a freemium game on Apple platforms and explore ways to acquire, engage, and retain players.\n\nAttracting players Engaging players Measuring performance\nAttracting players to your game\n\nEstablishing an engaged player base is important for your game’s long-term success. Optimize your product page to help players find your game on the App Store, as well as build awareness for your game before it’s launched. Take the time to create a thoughtful onboarding experience to help players get acquainted with your game and learn how to play.\n\nProduct page\n\nMaximize your game’s discoverability by making the most of your product page. Make sure your metadata — such as keywords, app name, icon, and screenshots — is compelling and accurately reflects your game. You can also add two subcategories in order to help players discover your game when searching the App Store or browsing subcategories on the App Store and in the Games and Apps tabs. Select the categories that best suit your game.\n\nAction\nAdventure\nBoard\nCard\nCasino\nCasual\nFamily\nMusic\nPuzzle\nRacing\nRole Playing\nSimulation\nSports\nStrategy\nTrivia\nWord\n\nLearn how to optimize your product page\n\nLearn how to choose a category\n\nPre-orders\n\nPlayers can pre-order your game up to 180 days before it’s been published on the App Store. Pre-orders can be placed from your product page, search results, and the Today, Games, or Apps tabs, if your game is featured. This can help you create excitement for your game and build an audience ahead of launch. Once your game is released for download, players are notified and it automatically downloads to their device within 24 hours. If you’d like, you can provide customers who pre-order your game an in-game gift — such as an exclusive item or free currency — to reward their interest and encourage engagement.\n\nLearn how to offer your app for pre-order\n\nDownload the ‘Pre-order on the App Store’ badge\n\nPromo codes\n\nYou can use promo codes to distribute your game or to offer in-app purchases for free to players. Promo codes can be created, distributed, and redeemed even before your game is live on the App Store, giving you opportunities to build awareness about your game ahead of launch. For example, you might share promo codes with influencers, journalists, or reviewers as a way to generate coverage about your game. You can provide up to 100 promo codes for each version of your app per platform, and up to 100 promo codes for each in-app purchase you offer.\n\nLearn about promo codes\n\nOnboarding players\n\nCreate an onboarding experience that helps new players understand your game and makes them likely to return. Successful onboarding teaches players the core loop (the essential activities of your game), how to purchase items, and reasons to keep playing. Be sure to include your game’s essential activities and allow players to start self-guided gameplay quickly. If your onboarding is too long or complex, you may lose players. Consider offering instructions on more complicated aspects of your game as multiple, short tutorials that are presented over time.\n\nLearn about onboarding for games\n\nPromoting in-app purchases\n\nYou can also promote in-app purchases on the App Store for iPhone and iPad so that they appear on your game’s product page and in search results, and may be featured on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs. This gives players a glimpse into the types of in-app purchases they’re able to buy and can help encourage downloads of your game.\n\nLearn how to promote in-app purchases\n\nUniversal purchase\n\nYou can distribute iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS versions of your game as a universal purchase to let players easily enjoy your game and in‑app purchases across platforms. This allows players to easily access your game on all Apple devices that your game supports.\n\nLearn about offering universal purchase\n\nGame controller support\n\nUse the Game Controller framework to support the use of game controllers for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. You can also use this framework to support keyboard, mouse, and trackpad inputs for iPadOS games and to augment gameplay with additional motion and custom haptics. When you indicate in Xcode that your game supports controllers, an icon indicating controller support displays on your App Store product page. Players on iOS 14 and tvOS 14 or later can access controller input remapping options in their device settings. If your game requires a controller, make sure you clearly explain this in your product page metadata so players know they need additional equipment to play.\n\nLearn about the Game Controller framework\n\nKeeping players engaged\n\nIn order to stay active within your game, players need to continue enjoying gameplay. Make sure to update your game with new content or challenges as well as feature enhancements to give players a reason to return.\n\nIn-app purchases\n\nIn-app purchases allow players to purchase digital items, such as currency and resources, to enhance their experience. You can offer four types of in-app purchases:\n\nConsumables. One-time use items that are spent or depleted — for example, in-game currency, equipment, or lives. Consumable in-app purchases often help a player progress more quickly in a game and can be purchased multiple times.\nNonconsumables. One-time purchase items that do not expire — for example, a bundle of additional levels, skins, or outfits.\nAuto-renewable subscriptions. Players have recurring access to content — for example, a VIP tier with exclusive items that are replenished on a regular basis. Learn about providing auto-renewable subscriptions.\nNonrenewing subscriptions. Limited-access content — for example, a seasonal or annual pass. This type of in-app purchase does not automatically renew, so players must manually renew each time their access expires.\n\nWhen planning your in-app purchases, think about how each offering relates to the essential activities of your game. You can display contextually appropriate content to help enhance a player’s gameplay — for example, if a player fails a level multiple times in a row, you might show them how a specific item can help them advance more easily and how that item can be obtained. You might also highlight any bonuses or savings to players to showcase the value of a particular in-app purchase. You can create up to 10,000 in-app purchases to offer in your game.\n\nLearn how to create and publish in-app purchases\n\nPush notifications\n\nPush notifications can help keep players engaged with your game by delivering relevant reminders and updates. For example, you might remind a player to complete a task or claim a daily bonus, which can encourage them to open your game. You can also use push notifications to market content, such as an in-app event currently taking place in your game or a sale on in-app purchases. Players must first explicitly opt in to receiving marketing push notifications via a method within your game that includes consent language and a clear way of opting out. To ensure a positive experience, be mindful of the frequency and timing of your notifications and make sure they’re relevant, provide valuable information, and serve a clear purpose. Do not include sensitive personal or confidential information in your push notifications.\n\nLearn how to design great push notifications\n\nLearn how to implement push notifications\n\nGame Center\n\nUse Game Center, Apple’s social gaming network, to allow players to enjoy your game with friends. Take advantage of the Game Center in-game access point and dashboard, which includes the player profile, leaderboards, and achievements, to encourage deeper engagement with your game. You can also use the GameKit framework to build multiplayer experiences.\n\nGames with Game Center integrated appear in the Friends Are Playing section on the App Store, where customers can discover and download the games their Game Center friends are playing. Customers can also see which friends are playing your game directly on your game’s App Store product page.\n\nLearn more about Game Center\n\nIn-app events\n\nIn-app events are timely events in your game that encourage engagement by providing new ways to interact with your game and receive rewards. These are part of a larger live operations strategy within your game and can occur once or repeat after a certain duration, such as monthly or yearly. Make sure any in-app events you offer have defined goals and eligibility requirements. For example, a competition that challenges players to surpass a certain level in a set amount of time in order to encourage deeper engagement.\n\nIn-app events can be promoted on the App Store on iOS and iPadOS, giving you an entirely new way to showcase them and expand their reach. In-app events appear across the App Store as event cards that include images or video, the event name, and a short description. When you want to promote an in-app event, you can easily set up and manage it in App Store Connect.\n\nLearn about in-app events\n\nBalanced gameplay and refunds\n\nMonitor your in-game activities, such as in-app events and in-app purchases, to make sure gameplay is balanced and your in-game economy is fair for all players. App Store server notifications provide real-time refund notifications for all types of in-app purchases, so you can manage refunds and take appropriate action — for example, adjusting a player’s currency balance in a game or restricting access to content unlocked by an in‑app purchase. For cases of refund abuse, you might consider temporarily suspending a player or banning their account. If you choose to take action, inform the player of any changes and let them know if there’s anything they need to do in response.\n\nFor more information, see Handling Refund Notifications.\n\nMeasuring performance\n\nApp Analytics in App Store Connect helps you evaluate the performance of your game with usage metrics, such as the number of sessions, active devices, and retention rates. This information can help you to evaluate the success of your onboarding efforts, as well as understand which acquisition sources result in more engaged players. You can use Sales and Trends to track the daily performance of your games and in-app purchases.\n\nLearn more about measuring performance\n\nMaximize your game’s potential\n\nCreate amazing gameplay experiences using the powerful suite of game technologies built to harness the full capabilities of Apple platforms. Spanning from high-level to low-level, these technologies offer a wide array of features to make your titles even better.\n\nLearn about Apple’s game technologies"

    "title": "Onboarding for Games - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/onboarding-for-games/",
    "html": "Onboarding for Games\n\nCreate an intuitive and engaging onboarding experience that makes a great first impression and helps keep players coming back. Onboarding teaches basic gameplay, how to purchase items, the benefits of returning, and more. A successful experience is fast, fun, and helpful so players can learn the essentials and jump right in.\n\nTeaching Through Tutorials\n\nBy using tutorials during onboarding, you can teach new players the core loop (i.e., essential activities of your game). For example, a role-playing game’s core loop might be to fight monsters, get rewarded with gold, and buy equipment to fight more challenging monsters. It’s also important to show additional sequences of actions players need to take to be successful. For example, if certain materials are needed to construct a building, show where to gather those materials and how to use them.\n\nIntroduce gameplay objectives so that they intuitively build on one another. Begin with basic elements and allow players to demonstrate competency before moving on to advanced objectives. To help players retain information more easily, teach one step at a time using short and clear instructions. If you assume knowledge that a player doesn’t have, they may feel discouraged and abandon the onboarding process.\n\nIf your game has multiple gameplay elements, consider delivering multiple short tutorials at relevant moments. For example, Clash Royale divides onboarding into five short tutorials that help players gradually learn how to play. Each tutorial introduces new and more complex elements, such as combining cards for a stronger attack, which build on information taught before. Earlier tutorials offer more guidance, while later tutorials challenge players to demonstrate what they’ve been taught.\n\nClash Royale\nPutting the Player Experience First\n\nGive players an active role during onboarding and let them start self-directed gameplay as soon as possible. Allow them to demonstrate what they’ve learned by playing unguided and consider providing a way to skip introductory sequences and tutorials if they wish to do so. Some players may already be familiar with the fundamentals of your game, or want to begin playing immediately.\n\nThe board game Carcassonne asks if you’d like the rules to be explained. If you choose “Go ahead”, you’re taken to a tutorial. If you choose “Later”, you can start playing.\n\nStart onboarding at launch. When possible, avoid showing splash screens, menus, agreements, or disclaimers when a new player opens your app, as these create a delay in quickly getting into gameplay. Consider displaying any necessary agreements or disclaimers on your product page on the App Store, so players can review this information before downloading your game. If you must include agreements or disclaimers within your game, integrate them in a balanced way that doesn’t disrupt the experience.\n\nPresent non-essentials after onboarding. If a task is not crucial to a player’s early objectives, introduce it once they’ve completed onboarding and are more familiar with your game. Avoid distracting players from completing onboarding with tasks such as rating the app or opting in to push notifications. Additional information that’s not directly related to core gameplay, such as daily challenges, tournaments, or leaderboards, can also be presented after the tutorial and explained in context.\n\nAnticipating the Need for Help\n\nPlayers may forget information that was presented in onboarding, so they may find it useful to replay tutorials or see contextual guidance and tips that reinforce key points. You may want to provide a dedicated reference section in your game that players can visit at any time to review controls and gameplay concepts.\n\nThe action game Super Fowlst includes a “How to Play” button on its introduction screen, allowing players to replay the tutorial at any time if they need a refresher.\n\nSuper Fowlst\nEncouraging Ongoing Engagement\n\nDuring your initial onboarding efforts, show players the benefit of routinely returning to your game, such as collecting daily rewards or participating in limited-time events. Rewards can be given once per day or multiple times per day, or they can increase in value with each consecutive visit. Make sure the benefits are compelling and reinforce your game’s main objectives.\n\nThe match-three game Toon Blast gives a daily reward to players who visit the game every day. This boosts retention by providing the incentive to return in order to receive items for use in gameplay. By letting players know that they can come back tomorrow for another prize, Toon Blast establishes a daily routine that loyal players can look forward to.\n\nToon Blast\nDemonstrating In-App Purchases\n\nIf your game includes in-app purchases, particularly consumables such as in-game currency, special items, or additional lives, briefly teach players about them so they can participate in this aspect of your game if they choose. Consider demonstrating a sample in-app purchase after the player has experienced normal gameplay. Illustrate the value of spending by describing the benefit of the item, showing where to purchase it — such as your store or market — and explaining how to use it.\n\nThe puzzle game Two Dots lets a player complete multiple levels before introducing premium items available for purchase. Before a player enters level 10, a tutorial introduces a “shuffler” item (one of several power-ups available) and teaches the player how to use it. After the player demonstrates how to use the shuffler, Two Dots displays the Market icon and lets them know that they can visit the Market to purchase more of the item.\n\nTwo Dots\nMeasuring Onboarding Success\n\nUse App Analytics in App Store Connect to track player engagement metrics, including the number of sessions, active devices, and retention rates. Retention rate data can help you evaluate the success of your onboarding efforts. For example, if there’s a drop in retention rates between day one and day seven, consider modifying your onboarding experience to see if rates improve.\n\nMore Resources\nHuman Interface Guidelines: Onboarding\nMaking a Great First Impression With Strong Onboarding Design"

    "title": "Promoting your in-app purchases - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/promoting-in-app-purchases/",
    "html": "Promoting your in-app purchases\n\nWith iOS, users can browse in-app purchases directly on the App Store and start a purchase even before downloading your app. Promoted in-app purchases appear on your product page, can display in search results, and may be featured on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs. Learn how to effectively increase discoverability for content previously only found inside your app.\n\nOverview\n\nYou can choose to promote up to 20 in-app purchases at a time on your product page, with additional in-app purchases approved and ready to promote. This gives you the flexibility to change the in-app purchases that appear on your product page at any time based on your business needs — for example, if you’re planning to launch a limited-time price promotion or offer exclusive content.\n\nPromoting in-app purchases can also encourage downloads of your app. When a user doesn’t have your app installed but wants to buy a promoted in-app purchase, they’ll receive a prompt to download the app first. Once the app is downloaded, the transaction will continue in the app.\n\nEnsuring a seamless purchase flow\n\nWhen a user starts an in-app purchase on the App Store, they are taken into your app to continue the transaction. Consider presenting the payment sheet as soon as they are in the app to make the process of completing their purchase as easy as possible. Avoid unnecessary interstitials and messaging, as each extra step you require may decrease the likelihood that the user will complete the purchase. If you are offering an auto-renewable subscription, you’ll need to explain how auto-renewal works in the purchase flow within your app.\n\nTo learn more about offering subscriptions in your app, see Auto-renewable Subscriptions.\n\nCustomizing promoted in-app purchases\n\nYou can customize which promoted in-app purchases a user sees on a specific device using the SKProductStorePromotionController API. For example, you can hide an item that a user already has on that device, or show the most relevant levels in a game based on their gameplay. Learn more by watching What’s New in StoreKit.\n\nIntroductory pricing\n\nYou can offer a discounted price or a free trial of an auto-renewable subscription to attract new subscribers. If your auto-renewable subscription is a promoted in-app purchase, the introductory price will display on the App Store for eligible customers running iOS 11.2 and later.\n\nLearn more about introductory prices\n\nHow to promote your in-app purchases\n\n1. Make sure your app supports a delegate method in SKPaymentTransactionObserver. You can choose to customize which promoted in-app purchases a user sees on a specific device by implementing SKProductStorePromotionController.\n\n2. Upload a promotional image for each in-app purchase you’d like to promote using App Store Connect. Learn more\n\n3. Select the in-app purchases you’d like to promote and choose the default order using App Store Connect. Learn more\n\nCreating effective metadata\n\nPromotional image. Each promoted in-app purchase requires a unique promotional image that best represents the in-app purchase. This image appears on your App Store product page; on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs if your content is featured; and can appear in search results. Please note that consumable in-app purchases will not appear in search results.\n\nPromotional images should not be screenshots, and should not be confused with your app icon.\n\nWe add a framing system to the image you upload to help convey that the in-app purchase is an addition to the app experience. When an in-app purchase appears on the App Store in places other than your product page — for example, in search results — your app icon is included in the lower left corner for further context. Ensure that your design isn’t obscured by the frame, and avoid putting important details in the lower left corner. We also recommend that you don’t overlay text on the image.\n\nThe file you upload will be a PNG or high-quality JPEG at 1024 x 1024 pixels. While this image is large for scaling purposes, your promotional image is usually seen at small sizes. Make sure that this image gracefully scales down to smaller sizes. For templates to help with the design of your promotional images, see Apple UI Design Resources.\n\nDisplay name. Make sure that the display names you choose when creating your in-app purchases will be easily understood by your users and by customers on the App Store. Avoid generic names like “100 gems” and tie the name to your app in some way. For auto-renewable subscriptions, include the duration of the in-app purchase. In-app purchase display names can be up to 30 characters long.\n\nDescription. The descriptions of your in-app purchases should make it easy to clearly distinguish the benefits of each offering. Descriptions can be up to 45 characters long.\n\nTo learn more about specifications for promotional images, display names, and descriptions, see App Store Connect Help.\n\nIn-app purchase metadata displayed on a product page.\n\nIn-app purchase metadata displayed in search results, Today, Games, and Apps tabs."

    "title": "App Bundles - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-bundles/",
    "html": "Offering app bundles\n\nApp bundles make it easy for customers to buy up to 10 of your apps or games in a single purchase. You can create app bundles for paid apps or free apps that offer an auto-renewable subscription to access all apps in the bundle. Learn how to set up app bundles and effectively market them on your product page.\n\nPreparing for app bundles\n\nYou can have a total of up to 10 app bundles available at any given time. An app may be included in up to three app bundles at any given time, and must also be available for individual download.\n\nAvailability. An app bundle is available in all territories where every individual app in the bundle is available. If an app contained in a bundle is removed from sale in a particular market, the app bundle will also be removed from sale in that market.\n\nPricing. Paid app bundles must offer a discount compared to the separate purchase price of the individual apps in the bundle. Paid apps and free apps with subscriptions cannot be bundled together.\n\nSubscriptions. For free apps with subscriptions, each app in the bundle must have an approved auto-renewable subscription. If a user subscribes in one app, they must be able to access all other apps in the bundle at no additional cost. Learn about offering subscriptions across multiple apps.\n\nAge ratings and bands. An app bundle is assigned the highest age rating of its component apps. For app bundles in the Kids category, if all apps within the bundle belong to the same age band, the that age band will be displayed on the bundle product page. If the apps have varying age bands, the bundle will not be assigned an age band.\n\nUniversal purchase. Apps that are part of a universal purchase, which lets customers easily enjoy your app and in‑app purchases across platforms, count as just one app in the bundle. Learn about universal purchase.\n\nComplete My Bundle. Paid app bundles support Complete My Bundle, which credits customers for apps they’ve already purchased within a bundle. They only pay the balance for the remaining apps.\n\nApp Store Connect\n\nFind details and step-by-step instructions on how to create and submit app bundles in App Store Connect.\n\nApp Store Connect Help\nMarketing your app bundles\n\nMake the most of your app bundle product page through thoughtfully crafted metadata. Each app bundle includes the opportunity to provide a unique icon, name, and description.\n\nIcon\n\nYour bundle icon consists of the icons of the first four apps included in the bundle. Consider placing your most popular apps first to highlight those most likely to spark a user’s interest. Ensure each app icon in the bundle is unique and focused on a single compelling image.\n\nName\n\nYour bundle name plays a critical role in how users discover your app bundle on the App Store. Choose a name that accurately reflects the contents of the bundle (e.g., Music Maker Bundle or Winter Sports Pack). Avoid using the terms “Editor’s Choice”, “Essentials”, or “Collection.” We recommend keeping your bundle name to around 20 characters so it displays properly across devices.\n\nDescription\n\nThe description of your app bundle should be concise and engaging. The first few sentences are the most important — this is what a user sees without having to tap to read more. The ideal description is a brief, attention-grabbing paragraph followed by a short bullet list of key features.\n\nFocus on the aspects of your app bundle that will motivate users to download it (e.g., the quality of the apps included, why they make sense as a bundle, the discount you’re offering).\n\nScreenshots\n\nThe first screenshot from each bundled app is displayed on the app bundle product page. Ideally, each screenshot clearly conveys the essence of the app.\n\nKeywords\n\nApp Store Connect compiles the keywords you enter for each of the bundled apps and uses them in your app bundle metadata."

    "title": "Categories and Discoverability - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/categories/",
    "html": "Choosing a category\n\nCategories on the App Store and Mac App Store help users discover new apps to fit their needs. Learn how to choose the most accurate and effective categories for your app.\n\nWhere categories are displayed\n\nYou can assign two categories to your app — a primary and a secondary category. The primary category you select is particularly important for your app’s discoverability on the App Store. This will be the category in which the app appears when users browse the App Store or filter search results, and it determines placement on the Apps tab or Games tab on the App Store for iPhone and iPad.\n\nFor Mac apps, the primary category you select is also the category in which the app appears when users browse the Mac App Store or filter search results, and it determines placement in the Categories tab on the Mac App Store in macOS 10.14 or later.\n\nChoosing a primary category\n\nLet’s say you have a photo-sharing social networking app. For the App Store, you could choose either Photo & Video or Social Networking as your primary category. To decide which category will best serve your app, consider the following:\n\nYour app’s purpose. Your primary category should be the one that best describes the main function or subject matter of your app.\nWhere users naturally look for an app like yours. Understanding your audience will help you identify the category in which they will likely look for your app. Will they consider your app to be more of a social network app or a photography app?\nWhich categories contain the same type of apps as yours. Research how similar apps are categorized — users may already know to visit these categories to find this type of app.\n\nMake sure that the category you choose accurately reflects your app’s core experience. Choosing categories that are not appropriate for your app is against the App Review Guidelines.\n\nSpecial cases\n\nApps for kids\nIf you have an app designed for kids ages 11 and under, select the Made for Kids checkbox in App Store Connect and choose an appropriate age band (5 and under, 6–8, or 9–11). Your app must comply with the App Review Guidelines for Kids apps and will go through review to be approved for the Kids category on the App Store. In addition to the Kids category, your app can be discovered in another primary and secondary category (for example: Games, Entertainment, or Education). For more details, see Building Apps for Kids.\n\nGames\nIf your app is a game, you can choose up to two Games subcategories. Users can find your app by browsing the subcategories on the App Store and in the Games subcategory charts. If you don’t know which subcategory best suits your game, research the types of games in each one before making your selection.\n\nStickers\nOn the App Store for iMessage, you can assign your sticker pack app to a category called Stickers, or to another primary category that best describes your app. If you use the Stickers category, you can also select a Stickers subcategory. Standalone sticker pack apps are not displayed in categories on the App Store for iPhone and iPad — they are discoverable only in search results. Categories for iOS app with iMessage extensions are taken from the iOS app and are used on the App Store for iPhone, iPad, and iMessage. For more details, see iMessage Apps and Stickers.\n\nBuilding a business in the Kids category\n\nOriginator shares its approach to building a sustainable business in the Kids category and how it got the word out about its Endless apps.\n\nCompare categories\n\nExplore and compare categories to see which best describes your app.\n\nBooks\n\nApps that provide extensive interactivity for content that is traditionally offered in printed form. If you’re planning a more traditional reading experience, you may want to look at publishing an iBook instead.\n\nFor example: stories, comics, eReaders, coffee table books, graphic novels.\n\nBusiness\n\nApps that assist with running a business or provide a means to collaborate, edit, or share content.\n\nFor example: document management (PDFs, scanning, file viewing/editing), VoIP telephony, dictation, remote desktop, job search resources, customer resource management, collaboration, enterprise resource planning, point of sale.\n\nDeveloper Tools\n\nApps that provide tools for app development, management, and distribution.\n\nFor example: coding, testing, debugging, workflow management, text and code editing.\n\nEducation\n\nApps that provide an interactive learning experience on a specific skill or subject.\n\nFor example: arithmetic, alphabet, writing, early learning and special education, solar system, vocabulary, colors, language learning, standardized test prep, geography, school portals, pet training, astronomy, crafts.\n\nEntertainment\n\nApps that are interactive and designed to entertain and inform the user, and which contain audio, visual, or other content.\n\nFor example: television, movies, second screens, fan clubs, theatre, ringtones, voice manipulation, ticketing services, art creation.\n\nFinance\n\nApps that perform financial transactions or assist the user with business or personal financial matters.\n\nFor example: personal financial management, mobile banking, investment, bill reminders, budgets, debt management, tax, small business finance, insurance.\n\nFood & Drink\n\nApps that provide recommendations, instruction, or critique related to the preparation, consumption, or review of food or beverages.\n\nFor example: recipe collections, cooking guides, restaurant reviews, celebrity chefs/recipes, dietary & food allergy, alcohol reviews, brewery guides, international cuisine.\n\nGames\n\nApps that provide single or multiplayer interactive activities for entertainment purposes.\n\nFor example: action, adventure, board, card, family, music, puzzle, racing, role playing, simulation, sports, strategy.\n\nGraphics & Design\n\nApps that provide tools for art, design, and graphics creation.\n\nFor example: vector graphic design, image editing, drawing and illustration.\n\nHealth & Fitness\n\nApps related to healthy living, including stress management, fitness, and recreational activities.\n\nFor example: yoga, muscle diagrams, workout tracking, running, cycling, stress management, pregnancy, meditation, weight loss, pilates, acupuncture/acupressure, Eastern/Chinese medicine.\n\nLifestyle\n\nApps relating to a general-interest subject matter or service.\n\nFor example: real estate, crafts, hobbies, parenting, fashion, home improvement.\n\nKids (iOS and iPadOS only)\n\nApps designed specifically for children ages 11 and under. Age-appropriate apps must be placed in one of three age bands based on their primary audience: 5 and under, 6–8, or 9–11.\n\nFor example: age-appropriate games, interactive stories, educational materials, magazines.\n\nMagazines & Newspapers\n\nApps that offer auto-renewing subscriptions to magazine or newspaper content. Choose Magazines & Newspapers if you deliver content using an issue-based strategy or are producing interactive versions of a printed periodical.\n\nFor example: newspapers, magazines, other recurring periodicals.\n\nMedical\n\nApps that are focused on medical education, information management, or health reference for patients or healthcare professionals.\n\nFor example: skeletal, muscular, anatomy, medical record-keeping, diseases, symptom reference, companion devices (blood pressure, pulse, and so on), health tracking.\n\nMusic\n\nApps that are for discovering, listening to, recording, performing, or composing music, and that are interactive in nature.\n\nFor example: music creation, radio, education, sound editing, music discovery, composition, lyric writing, band and recording artists, music videos and concerts, concert ticketing.\n\nNavigation\n\nApps that provide information to help a user travel to a physical location.\n\nFor example: driving assistance, walking assistance, topographical maps, maritime, pilot logs/assistance, oceanic tides, road atlas, fuel finders, public transit maps.\n\nNews\n\nApps that provide information about current events or developments in areas of interest such as politics, entertainment, business, science, technology, and so on. Choose News if your app serves content via newsreader or digest format, or if your app is for a digital-first or broadcast-first media outlet with frequent content updates.\n\nFor example: television, video, radio, or online news outlets or programs, RSS readers.\n\nPhoto & Video\n\nApps that assist in capturing, editing, managing, storing, or sharing photos and videos.\n\nFor example: capture, editing, special effects, sharing, imaging, printing, greeting card creation, manuals.\n\nProductivity\n\nApps that make a specific process or task more organized or efficient.\n\nFor example: task management, calendar management, translation, note taking, printing, password management, cloud storage, email clients, flow chart generators, audio dictation, simulation, data viewing.\n\nReference\n\nApps that assist the user in accessing or retrieving information.\n\nFor example: atlas, dictionary, thesaurus, quotations, encyclopedia, general research, animals, law, religion, how-tos, politics.\n\nSafari Extensions (macOS only)\n\nApps that offer extensions to help enhance and customize the web browsing experience on Safari.\n\nFor example: content bookmarkers, password managers, adblockers, savings finders.\n\nShopping\n\nApps that support the purchase of consumer goods or materially enhance the shopping experience.\n\nFor example: commerce, marketplace, coupon, product review, apps with Apple Pay.\n\nSocial Networking\n\nApps that connect people by means of text, voice, photo, or video.

    "title": "Creating app previews for your iOS and iPadOS AR apps - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ar-app-previews/",
    "html": "Creating app previews for your iOS and iPadOS AR apps\n\nYou can create short videos using footage captured on iPhone or iPad to help customers understand what to expect from your immersive augmented reality (AR) experience. App previews autoplay on the App Store, making them an effective and engaging tool for helping users discover and learn about your app.\n\nOverview\n\nApps that use ARKit seamlessly blend realistic virtual objects with the real world. Use app previews to show users what they can do with the virtual objects placed into their surroundings.\n\nNote that your video should be taken from directly within the app and should not include people interacting with the device, such as over-the-shoulder angles.\n\nChoosing a location and setting\n\nChoose a setting that is uncluttered and well lit. Make sure that there aren’t any physical objects that might get in the way of the virtual content — a busy environment may distract or confuse your audience. However, you’ll need to ensure that there are enough details in the physical environment for the app to track, so that your virtual content doesn’t appear to jump around. For example, use a surface with texture so when the camera moves, the app can recognize and understand the scene.\n\nWhether you record in a public space or a private location, be mindful of your surroundings and don’t capture material that you don’t have permission to show. This can include people, logos, branded products, artwork, computer hardware, murals or signage on buildings, and other intellectual property.\n\nWhen depicting multiplayer experiences, ensure that the devices of other players are not visible in your footage.\n\nRecording footage\n\nYou can capture screen recordings of your AR app by connecting your iOS device to your Mac with a Lightning cable. Learn more about how to record video for app previews.\n\nIf you need to move around to show the experience of using your app, you can use the Screen Recording feature in iOS 11. To access this feature, go to Settings > Control Center > Customize Controls, and add Screen Recording to your Control Center. When you’re ready to record, swipe up from the bottom of your screen to access the record button.\n\nWhen capturing footage of your AR app, ensure that the camera movement is smooth and controlled. Excessive motion — too far, too fast, or vigorous shaking — can blur the image or reduce the tracking quality, making it hard to watch.\n\nCreating establishing shots\n\nSet up the app before you start recording, so that the physical details and surfaces are already detected. To help users distinguish what is virtual from what is real, particularly when a virtual object is designed to look real, use the first few seconds of your app preview to show the object being placed into a user’s surrounding or being manipulated. For example, you might show a virtual couch moving in a room or show the fabric changing on the couch.\n\nUsing graphics and audio\n\nConsider adding graphic elements, such as animated touch spots, when you need to demonstrate how interaction works within the app. This can be helpful when virtual objects are being scaled, repositioned, or rotated by the user. For example, if an object is scaled without showing the gesture causing it, the viewer may think that the object is advancing or receding from the camera.\n\nYou can also use audio feedback, such as sound effects from the app, to help communicate when an action is being performed.\n\nDisplaying your app preview on the App Store\n\nYou can show up to three app previews on the App Store in iOS 11. If your app offers both AR and two-dimensional functionality, consider displaying your AR app preview first to highlight this new capability.\n\nFor general guidance on app previews, read Show more with app previews.\n\nReferring to AR experiences\n\nAugmented reality is an advanced concept that may be new to users. To help make it approachable, you can refer to it in short form in your app description: AR app or AR game. Only use AR to refer to apps that offer actual augmented reality functionality.\n\nYou can also choose to mention AR in one of three other metadata fields: your app name, subtitle, or keywords.\n\nScreenshots\n\nYour screenshots should be taken from directly within the app and should not include any over-the-shoulder views. If your app offers both AR and two-dimensional functionality, consider using your first screenshot to highlight the AR functionality. Your first screenshot appears in search results alongside your first app preview."

    "html": "Marketing Resources and Identity Guidelines\n\nWe believe that powerful marketing will help bring continued success for your apps. Use App Store badges, Apple product images, and these identity guidelines to effectively promote your app’s availability on the App Store in all marketing communications.\n\nApp Store Badges \nProduct Images \nPhotography + Video \nMessaging + Style \nLegal Requirements\nApp Store Badges\n\nInclude App Store badges in all digital and printed marketing materials as a clear call to action to get your app. App Store badges are available in 40 localizations to help you reach a broader audience. Versions are available for the App Store for iPhone and iPad, the Mac App Store, and Apple TV.\n\nMarketing Tools\n\nGenerate embeddable code that leads to your App Store product page and displays an App Store badge, your app icon, or a QR code. You can also download specific badges based on language and style.\n\nApp Store Marketing Tools\n\nDownload (All Versions)\nDownload Artwork (263 MB)\nDownload Artwork (263 MB)\nDownload Artwork (263 MB)\nDownload Artwork (263 MB)\nDownload Artwork (264 MB)\nDownload Artwork (255 MB)\nPreferred Badges\n\nUse the preferred black badge in all marketing communications promoting your app. The gray border surrounding the black badge is part of the badge artwork and should not be modified. Whenever one or more badges for other app platforms appear in the layout, use the preferred black badge. Place the App Store badge first in the lineup of badges.\n\nAlternative Badges\n\nThe alternative white badge is designed to give you greater versatility and can be used when the preferred black badge appears visually heavy in the layout. The alternative badge is suitable when only one badge appears in the layout and when it complements the colors used in the layout. If badges for other app platforms appear in your communication, use the preferred black badge, not the alternative white badge.\n\nLocalized Badges\n\nApple provides badge artwork with the modifiers Download on the and Pre-order on the translated into regional languages. The service mark App Store always appears in English. Never translate App Store or create your own localized badge.\n\nAvailable in Azərbaycan dili, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Melayu, Čeština, Dansk, Deutsch, Eesti Keel, English, Español, Français, Italiano, Latviski, Lietuviškai, Magyar, Malti, Nederlands, Norsk, Polski, Português, Português Brasil, Pусский, Română, Slovenčina, Slovenščina, Suomi, Svenska, Tagalog, Tiếng Việt, Türkçe, Ελληνικά, български, עברית, العربية , ภาษาไทย, 한국어, 日本語, 简体中文, 繁體中文.\n\nBadge Use\n\nUse one App Store badge per layout or video. Place the badge in a subordinate position to the image or main message so that it isn’t the dominant artwork. Don’t modify, angle, or animate the App Store badge.\n\nUse the pre-order badge to indicate that your app is available for pre-order on the App Store. Once the app is released for download, be sure to replace the pre-order badge with the download badge in all of your marketing materials. For more information on making your apps available for pre-order, see Offering Your Apps for Pre-Order.\n\nUse only the badge artwork provided in these guidelines. Don’t use icons, logos, graphics, or images from www.apple.com to promote your app. Never use the Apple logo in place of the word Apple. Don’t use the standalone Apple logo.\n\nLink to Your App\n\nGenerate short links or embeddable code that lead to your App Store product page and display your app icon, a QR code, or an App Store badge.\n\nView App Store marketing tools\n\nHeadline\nApp Name\nSubtitle or Tagline\nApp Name\nMac App Store\nGraphic Standards\n\nMinimum clear space is equal to one-quarter the height of the badge. Don’t place photos, typography, or other graphic elements inside the minimum clear space.\n\nMinimum badge height is 10 mm for use in printed materials and 40 px for use onscreen. Select a size that is clearly legible but not dominant in the layout.\n\nWhen the badge is placed on advertising with very limited layout space, such as banners for mobile devices, select a badge size that is clearly legible on the target mobile devices. Minimum clear space for very limited layout space is equal to one-tenth the height of the badge.\n\nFor printed materials, the badge can be printed in one color if black and white inks are not used on the layout. The line art portion of the badge (Apple logo, type, and outline rule) can be printed in the ink color used on the layout as long as it provides sufficient contrast for clear legibility.\n\n10mm. 40px\nOne-tenth badge height for very limited layout space\nApple Product Images\n\nUse Apple-provided product bezels in all your marketing materials to display your app on the Apple devices it supports. Always use the latest-generation devices for which your app is currently developed.\n\nDownload Apple Product Bezels\nImage Use\n\nFeature Apple product images on their own in your communications, and don’t include images of competing products. References to multiple platforms and competing products can be made only in copy or with badges.\n\nUse Apple product images “as is” and without modification. Modifications include adding reflections, shadows, highlights, or graphic elements that appear to enter or come out of the product screen; cropping, tilting, or obstructing any part of the images; animating, flipping, or spinning the images; or creating buttons or icons with a product image. You can place promotional copy or violators beside the product images, not on top of them.\n\nGraphic Standards\n\nUse Apple product images at a size that is clearly legible at the image resolution provided. Ensure that the minimum device size is no smaller than 25 mm in height for printed materials and 200 px onscreen. Maintain the correct relative product scale whenever multiple products are shown.\n\nUnauthorized Uses\n\nThe following uses of Apple products are not permitted in marketing materials:\n\nRendering in 3D or creating any simulation of an Apple product\nIllustrations that depict an Apple product, except for instructional material\nDie-cut promotions in the shape of an Apple product\nFood industry disposable packaging or promotions that use an Apple product or App Store badge\nDecals, bumper stickers, or magnets placed on the outside of any vehicle that use an Apple product or App Store badge\nGraphics, illustrations, or logotypes to represent an Apple product\n\nIf your marketing contains illustrations of generic devices, ensure that these devices do not include details that are unique to Apple products, such as the iPhone Home button, sensor housing, Ring/Silent switch, or volume controls.\n\nScreen Content\n\nFocus on the experience of using your app and not on Apple product functions. Display your app on the screen as it appears when your app is running. For apps that work within Messages, Siri, Phone, or Maps, display your app within the Apple UI exactly as it appears when your app is running. Apps that support widgets may display this functionality in screen content as long as no third-party content is shown on the Home Screen. Be sure to create screens using the latest operating system version. Don’t display a blank screen on an Apple product, or on a television screen when showcasing Apple TV.\n\nYou are responsible for securing the rights to all materials used in screen content within your app, and you should display fictional account information instead of data from a real person. For the screen content of apps that work within Apple apps, you are responsible for securing the rights and approvals for third-party content such as store names or locations.\n\nStatus Bar\n\nThe status bar for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch should show a full network icon or product designator, a full Wi-Fi icon, and a full battery icon. If your app runs full screen, you can extend your app screen image over the status bar. If your app is optimized for 5G networks, you can display the 5G icon in the status bar from a compatible device.\n\nStatus bar options are provided on different layers within the Smart Object layer. Be sure to select the correct localized layer for the region in which your marketing communications will appear.\n\nPush Notifications\n\nWhen showing push notifications from your app in advertising, display a single push notification on the lock screen of the Apple device. Don’t include multiple push notifications from your app, or other app’s push notifications. If tapped, the push notification must open the app directly. Don’t show the Home Screen of the Apple device.\n\nHome Screen\n\nIf your app supports widgets, you may show your app’s widget on the Home Screen as long as no third-party content is depicted in your communications. Otherwise, don’t display an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, or Apple TV Home Screen.\n\nFor product images of iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air in the desktop display option, remember to add your icon to the Dock and customize the menu bar titles to match your app’s menu bar.\n\nCustom Photography and Video\n\nCustom photography and video of Apple products are allowed. Show people interacting with the Apple product in an authentic way, and feature your app in a realistic manner, exactly as a user will experience it.\n\n \nProduct Use\n\nStraight-on product shots are preferred. Don’t use extreme angles or alter an Apple product in any way. The product’s color, shape, size, and form must be accurate. Don’t engage in “suspension of disbelief” by showing Apple products or your app in a fantastic or unrealistic manner.\n\nOnly show the back of a device in an authentic manner to illustrate natural use of the device. Don’t feature the Apple logo to take advantage of the promotional value of the Apple brand. Don’t obscure or cover the logo.\n\nIn video, once you show an establishing shot of the entire Apple device, you may pan and zoom to focus on your app. Present the movement in a simple, clear manner. Use straightforward transitions such as fade or dissolve. Don’t use Apple user interaction gestures such as Multi-Touch or trackpad swipes to perform scene transitions.\n\nStart the app sequence with your app open. If app sequences are shortened, display a “sequences shortened” disclaimer. You can use the sounds that your app makes naturally as audio elements of your video, but don’t use the native sounds of the Apple device.\n\nFocus on the experience of using your app running on the latest operating system. Don’t display a blank screen on an Apple product, or on a television screen when showcasing Apple TV. For more details, see Screen Content.\n\nApproved Devices\n\nUse only the devices and colors provided. If multiple Apple products are shown, display them in the correct relative sizes. Always display the product “as is” — don’t add cases or covers. Don’t show an Apple product along with a competing product from another manufacturer. For Apple TV communications, avoid showing the television manufacturer’s name.\n\nTrademark Attribution\n\nInclude Apple credit lines wherever legal information is provided. At the end of a video, display the correct credit lines for Apple trademarks used in your video as described in Legal Requirements below. Maintain clear-space requirements when credit lines follow the badge.\n\nMessaging and Writing Style\n\nWhen promoting your app, your headline and copy should focus on your app, not on Apple product features. Use clear, simple messaging. Always include a call to action to download your app.\n\nRefer to the correct product names your app supports, and avoid referring to iOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS in your marketing communications. Don’t refer to Apple devices generically as “smartphones” or “tablets.” Use the product names.\n\nProduct Names\n\nUse Apple product names such as Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple TV in a referential phrase to indicate that your app is compatible with these products. For example, say app name for iPhone or app name for iPad, or use a phrase such as works with or compatible with. Don’t say iPhone app name.\n\nList all the Apple products that your app runs on. Don’t list Apple products that are not compatible with your app.\n\nWhen including your company name, lead with the company name followed by the app name and end with the appropriate Apple product names. For example, it is correct to say Company name App name for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.\n\nSpelling and Language\n\nAlways use the correct Apple product names with the correct capitalization as shown on the Apple Trademark List. Always use Apple product names in singular form. Modifiers such as model, device, or collection can be plural or possessive. Never typeset Apple product names using all uppercase letters.\n\niPhone, iPad, and iPod touch\n\nAlways typeset iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with a lowercase i and an uppercase P followed by lowercase letters. Always typeset touch with a lowercase t. The name iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch should start with a lowercase i even when it is the first word in a sentence, paragraph, or title. Don’t use variations such as touch or iTouch. Never use a lowercase i followed by all uppercase letters.\n\niPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR\n\nFor headlines and copy, use an uppercase X, small cap S, and small cap R whenever technically possible and when you can ensure efficient and accurate implementation. For example: iPhone XS Max. When you cannot ensure that small caps will render accurately or when technical limitations may prevent the display of small caps, use an uppercase X, S, and R. For example: iPhone XS Max.\n\nTo implement small caps on webpages, make sure your specified font supports OpenType and use the font-variant CSS property font-variant: small-caps;.\n\nMacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iMac\n\nMac is always set with an uppercase M followed by lowercase letters; MacBook is one word with an uppercase M and B; and iMac always begins with a lowercase i followed by an uppercase M followed by lowercase letters. iMac begins with a lowercase i even when it is the first word in a sentence.\n\nApple Watch\n\nAlways typeset Apple Watch as two words with an uppercase A and an uppercase W followed by lowercase letters. Don’t break Apple Watch over two lines. Don’t use the article the before Apple Watch. Apple Watch apps are available on the App Store or can be downloaded on the App Store. It is acceptable to say Name of app for Apple Watch when your promotion is focused on your app features and benefits related to Apple Watch.\n\nWhen promoting your app, your headlines and copy should focus on your app, not on Apple Watch features. Don’t use the word watch or time as a pun or verb in your marketing materials.\n\nWhen referring to Apple Watch, include the series number, such as Apple Watch Series 6, depending on the features and functionality available in your app.\n\nApple TV\n\nApple TV is typeset as two words with an uppercase A followed by lowercase letters, and an uppercase TV. If your app is offered only for Apple TV, clarify that your app is exclusive to Apple TV and available only from the App Store on Apple TV.\n\nApp Store\n\nAlways typeset App Store with an uppercase A and an uppercase S followed by lowercase letters.\n\nRefer to just the App Store unless you need to be more specific; in that case, you can use App Store for iPhone, App Store for iPad, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV, App Store for Apple Watch, or App Store for iMessage. To refer to all the versions, use this order: App Store for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and iMessage. Don’t use terms such as Apple Watch App Store or App Store for watchOS.\n\nInclude only the article the before App Store and Mac App Store. Never include other descriptors; for example, don’t say iTunes App Store, Apple App Store, or iPhone App Store. Don’t add superlatives such as the best App Store. It is correct to say that an app is available on the App Store or can be downloaded from the App Store. Don’t use at the App Store. Don’t use the term downloadable.\n\nApple Apps and Services\n\nWhen using the Apple names Apple Pay, Wallet, Messages, Siri, Phone, or Maps, always typeset with a capital letter. iMessage, the service within the Messages app, must be spelled with a lowercase i and an uppercase M followed by lowercase letters.\n\nView Apple Pay guidelines\nView Apple Wallet guidelines\n\nOther Platforms\n\nApple product names can appear in copy along with the names of other app platforms or devices. List Apple products first. Although the names of other products can be used in promotional copy, never display Apple product images alongside the images of other products.\n\nURL Address Naming\n\nApple trademark names can be included in your URL address only when the trademark follows your company and/or product name. Apple trademarks can be used in URLs only for web pages that feature apps developed specifically for the Apple product named. Never start a URL with an Apple trademark.\n\nAcceptable: www.company.com/app/iphone or www.company.com/ipad\nNot acceptable: www.iphoneapp.com or www.ipadweatherapp.com\n\nDo Not Translate\n\nAlways set Apple trademarks in English, even when they appear within text in a language other than English. Terms that should not be translated or transliterated include:\n\nApp Store\nApple Pay\nApple Pencil\nApple TV\nApple Watch\niMac\niPad\niPhone\niPod touch\nMacBook Air\nMacBook Pro\nSiri\n\nFor a list of Apple trademarks, please see the Apple Trademark List.\n\n\n\nLegal Requirements\nTrademark Symbols\n\nIn communications distributed only in the United States, the appropriate symbol (™, ℠, or ®) must follow each Apple trademark the first time it is mentioned in body copy. Do not use trademark symbols on products, product documentation, or other product communications that will be distributed outside the United States.\n\nFor example, use Apple Watch®, iPhone®, iPad®, iPod touch®, Apple TV®, App Store®, Mac App Store℠, Mac®, MacBook Pro®, MacBook Air®, and iMac®.\n\nDon’t add symbols to headline copy or to the App Store badge artwork provided by Apple.\n\nFor the correct trademark symbols, refer to the Apple Trademark List.\n\nCredit Lines\n\nUse the appropriate credit lines in all communications worldwide, listing all the Apple trademarks and products included in your communication and advertising. Include the credit lines only once in your communication or website, and place the credit lines wherever you provide legal notification. Follow standard practices for the placement of legal copy, such as creating additional screens or providing interactive links. When the App Store badge is used, credit both Apple and the Apple Logo.\n\nRefer to the Apple Trademark List for the correct trademark symbol, spelling of the trademark, and generic term to use with the trademark. Generally, the symbol appears at the right shoulder of the trademark (except the Apple Logo, where the logo appears at the right foot).\n\nUse the following formats for distribution within the United States only:\n\n______ and ______ are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.\n\n______ and ______ are trademarks of Apple Inc.\n\nFor distribution outside the United States, use one of the following international credit notices:\n\n______ and______ are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.\n\n______ and______ are trademarks of Apple Inc.\n\nA translation of the legal notice and credit lines (but not the trademarks) can be used in materials distributed outside the U.S.\n\nFor more information on using Apple trademarks, see Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights.\n\nAssociation with Apple\n\nYour app screen images, Mac, Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV product images, or photographs thereof cannot be used in any manner that falsely suggests an association with Apple or is likely to reduce, diminish, or damage the goodwill, value, or reputation associated with the App Store, the Mac App Store, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or Apple itself.\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING APP STORE MARKETING ARTWORK LICENSE AGREEMENT (“MARKETING AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING OR USING THE APPLE ARTWORK (AS DEFINED BELOW).

    "html": "Choosing a business model\n\nThe App Store empowers you to scale your app distribution worldwide using a variety of business models. The right business model for your app balances your goals with your target market’s expectations. Choosing your business model before developing your app can inform your app design decisions for a cohesive user experience.\n\nFreeFreemiumPaidPaymium\nFree\n\nWith free models, users don’t pay to download or use your app. Removing the barrier of price increases the likelihood that users in your target market will download and try your app, which can help increase awareness and expand your user base. If you’re looking to grow your brand or attract a large user base, consider offering your app for free.\n\nFree without monetization. Your app doesn’t offer in-app purchases or the ability to buy physical goods or services within the app, and doesn’t display advertisements. You don’t earn any revenue from your app.\n\nFree with physical goods and services. Users can purchase physical goods and services — such as clothing or food — within your app or order rides from transportation services. You earn revenue from these sales.\n\nFree with display advertising. Display advertisements are part of the app experience and you earn revenue when presenting them. Make sure that all display advertisements in your app are appropriate and relevant to your target market, as low-quality, obtrusive, or inappropriate advertising reduces engagement and retention.\n\nYour app and any third-party SDKs you use to help target display advertising or measure advertising efficacy need to follow the Data Use and Sharing and the Advertising sections of the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nReader. Users purchase or subscribe to content — such as magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video — outside of your app and enjoy access to that content within your app. You generate revenue outside of the app. For more information, see the “Reader” Apps section of the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nFreemium\n\nWith freemium models, users pay nothing to download your app and are offered optional in-app purchases for premium features, additional content, subscriptions, or digital goods. Freemium apps are accessible to all users, regardless of whether or not they choose to spend, and offer the option to pay to enhance or customize the experience. You earn revenue from the sales of in-app purchases within your app. Successful freemium apps operate as services that are continually updated to attract and retain users. You can offer multiple types of in-app purchases, including subscriptions.\n\nIn-app purchase types\n\nConsumable. Users can purchase different types of consumables, such as lives or gems in a game, to further their progress through an app. Consumable in-app purchases are depleted as they’re used, and can be purchased again.\n\nNon-consumable. Users can purchase non-consumable, premium features within an app. Non-consumables are purchased once and do not expire, such as additional filters in a photo app. Apple can host content associated with your non-consumable in-app purchases.\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions. Users can purchase access to services or periodically updated content, such as monthly access to cloud storage or a weekly subscription to a magazine. Users are charged on a recurring basis until they decide to cancel. Learn more about subscriptions.\n\nNon-renewing subscriptions. Users can purchase access to services or content for a limited duration, such as a season pass to streaming content. This type of subscription does not renew automatically, so users need to renew each time.\n\nIf you wish, you can allow users to access content or services across multiple Apple devices, as well as other platforms. If you offer any multiplatform functionality, be sure any purchasable items or services outside of the app are also available as in-app purchases within your app. For more information, see the Multiplatform Services section of the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nLearn about different freemium experiences\n\nPaid\n\nIn the paid model, users pay once to download your app and use all of its functionality. There are no additional charges or in-app purchases. You earn revenue from the sales of your app. This model resonates with users who prefer to pay once to get the full experience. Because the cost to download might make users consider the app’s value more carefully, successful paid apps are often positioned as premium experiences through outstanding design, functionality, and marketing.\n\nPaymium\n\nIn this combination of the paid and freemium models, users pay to download your app and have the option to buy additional features, content, or services through in-app purchases if they want to engage more deeply. It offers the possibility of lowering the app’s download price while using in-app purchases for ongoing monetization. Successful paymium apps offer premium design, functionality, and content, as well as advanced features intended to complement the experience.\n\nAs with paid apps, the cost to download might make users consider the app’s value more carefully. Set expectations about what users get when they pay up front and what they’ll get if they purchase optional enhancements. Keep in mind that creating in-app purchases for features that are required to use the app can cause a negative experience and may affect your sales and retention.\n\nApp Store Small Business Program\n\nThe App Store Small Business Program is designed to accelerate innovation and help propel your small business forward with the next generation of groundbreaking apps on the App Store. It features a reduced commission rate of 15% on paid apps and in-app purchases, so you can invest more resources into your business to continue building quality apps that customers love.\n\nLearn about the program"

    "html": "You can now offer pre-orders by region. Learn more\n\nOffering apps and games for pre-order\n\nBuild excitement for your app’s launch by making it available for pre-order on the App Store. People can order your app before it’s released, and it’ll automatically download onto their devices on release day.\n\nOverview\n\nWith pre-orders, you can increase awareness and momentum for your app or game’s launch before it’s released on the App Store. When you offer your app for pre-order, a limited version of your product page is published on the App Store and people can order your app before it’s released. Pre-orders are also discoverable in search results, as well as on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs if your app is being actively featured.\n\nPre-orders let you release your app in specific regions and set a different release date for each region. With this flexibility, you can offer pre-orders for brand-new apps that have never been published on the App Store and use them to bring existing apps into new regions.\n\nOn release day, your app automatically downloads onto the devices of people who have pre-ordered and they receive a notification so they can start experiencing your app right away.\n\nConfiguration and eligibility\n\nConfigure and manage pre-orders in App Store Connect, in the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps. For each pre-order, you’ll select an expected release date and the regions where you’d like to offer it. The length of the pre-order period is based on the status and availability of your app. Brand-new apps can have a release day that’s 2 to 180 days after the pre-order is published, while existing apps can have a release date in a new region that’s 2 to 365 days after the pre-order is published. Once your app has been submitted and reviewed by App Review, you can publish your pre-order. Pre-orders can be made on devices running iOS 11.2, iPadOS 13, tvOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and watchOS 6 or later.\n\nMarketing pre-orders\n\nYou can use the App Store pre-order badge in your marketing materials to let people know it’s available for pre-order and encourage them to order your app. You can also promote pre-orders in your own marketing channels, such as your website, mailing list, and social media accounts. Include a clear call-to-action — for example, “Pre-order on the App Store” — and provide a direct link to your product page. Additionally, you can use Apple Search Ads to promote your app while it’s available for pre-order.\n\nYour product page displays an expected release date. If there’s a chance this date will shift, we recommend that you don’t include this date in your marketing efforts. Keep in mind that people who pre-order your app aren’t notified by Apple of date changes or if you remove the pre-order from the App Store, so you’ll need to communicate any adjustments.\n\nOn release day, be sure to update all of your marketing materials and App Store badges to share that your app is now available to download on the App Store.\n\nExisting apps can use custom product pages and product page optimization for their pre-order product page. With custom product pages, you can create additional versions of the product page to highlight a particular feature or specific content. Share each page’s unique URL in your corresponding marketing materials. With product page optimization, you can test up to three alternate product page versions against the original, view the results in App Analytics, and set the best performing version to display to everyone on the App Store.\n\nUse the preorder_date receipt field to identify people who pre-ordered your app and use this information to display in-app messaging that thanks them for their purchase, or unlock rewards for them — such as additional gems in a game.\n\nView and download App Store badges\nLearn about custom product pages\nLearn about product page optimization\nMeasuring success\n\nMeasure the success of your app’s pre-orders in App Store Connect. App Analytics helps you understand how pre-orders perform over time, and includes the number of pre-orders broken down by date, region, and source type.\n\nYou can also track the performance of pre-orders in Sales and Trends, where you’ll find the number of purchased pre-orders and cancellations, and download this information as a report.\n\nLearn about pre-order report\n\nRelated\nProviding promo codes\nCreating your product page\nCustom product pages\nChoosing a business model\nProduct page optimization\nPromoting your in-app purchases"

    "title": "App Previews - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-previews/",
    "html": "Show more with app previews\n\nEngage users with short videos of your iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, or visionOS app in action, directly on the App Store. Since app previews autoplay, they’re key in helping users discover and learn about your app.\n\nOverview\n\nApp previews demonstrate the features, functionality, and user interface of your app using footage captured on device. You can have up to three app previews for each language your app supports, and each preview can be up to 30 seconds long. The following tips can help you create compelling previews that spark interest and drive downloads of your app.\n\nPlanning your app preview\n\nThink about using your first app preview to show an overview of the app experience, focusing on the app’s core features and content. Aim to tell a cohesive story that gives users a sense of the journey they’ll experience when using your app.\n\nYou can create a second or third preview to highlight additional features or specific content that users might not know about. If you have multiple previews, make sure that each video shows users something new about your app.\n\nSince videos autoplay on the App Store, it’s important to get to the point quickly. Use the first few moments of your preview to get users excited to download your app by showing them what makes your app unique.\n\nDevelop an outline or storyboard for each video that maps out a list of scenes you’ll need, and consider how many seconds you want to devote to each scene. Craft messaging to explain UI transitions or features.\n\nConsider any demo content you may need to create. Make sure to use sample accounts when displaying personal information in your app previews.\n\nContent and format\n\nApp previews are for all audiences, so they must be appropriate for ages four and older. Avoid objectionable content, violence, adult themes, and profanity.\n\nApp previews may only use captured footage of the app itself. Don’t film people interacting with the device (such as over-the-shoulder angles or fingers tapping the screen), and don’t use app previews to show behind-the-scenes footage of your app’s development. Stay within the app.\n\nShow only material you have the legal right to display. If your app displays protected content such as music, film, trademarked characters, brands, or other intellectual property assets, ensure you have the appropriate licensing rights for your marketing use in all territories. If your app accesses the iTunes Library, use only songs that you’ve created or that you’ve specifically licensed for use in the preview.\n\nGraphics and transitions\n\nAdd graphic elements, such as touch hotspots, when necessary to demonstrate how navigation or interaction works within the app. Don’t overlay animated hands simulating gestures.\n\nWe recommend capturing the native resolution of the UI instead of zooming in on the view. Ensure that transitions between scenes don’t imply functionality that your app doesn’t have. Use straightforward transitions like dissolves and fades.\n\nGet your audience excited about the elements they’ll actively engage with once they download the app. Show more gameplay than cutscenes so you don’t mislead your audience by giving a false impression of gameplay.\n\nUsing copy\n\nSince app previews play with the sound muted by default on the App Store, consider using copy to give context to the footage. Use easily understandable terms and language that will appeal to your target audience. Ensure that text is legible and remains on the screen long enough for your audience to read it.\n\nTo keep your app preview evergreen, we recommend avoiding references to specific events, seasons, or memes that will date it (such as, “New for spring”). We also recommend leaving out references to pricing in your app preview. Pricing is already shown on your App Store product page, and references in the preview may not be accurate in all regions.\n\nIf you display features that are only available through in-app purchase, or if your app uses a subscription model or requires login, you must disclose this. Disclaimer copy can be included within the footage or in the end frame.\n\nOverlaying audio\n\nConsider overlaying the musical score of your app as the soundtrack to your app preview to establish continuity, even when one scene cuts to the next. You can also capture the sound effects of your UI in your footage to reinforce functionality in your app.\n\nIf you decide to use a voiceover to enhance your app preview, consider working with a professional voiceover actor and recording with high-quality audio equipment in locations without background noise to deliver the best user experience. This is the voice of your app — make sure it resonates.\n\nSelecting a poster frame\n\nPoster frames appear wherever app previews do not autoplay, so it’s important to select a visually compelling frame from your footage. Ideally, the poster frame will convey the essence of the app. If the default frame selected from your footage doesn’t convey this, you can select a different frame in App Store Connect. Note that changing the poster frame on an app preview that has already been approved will require you to submit a new version of your app preview. For details on how to change your poster frame, see App Store Connect Help.\n\nCapturing and editing footage\n\nCapture app footage from the device using QuickTime Player on macOS simply by connecting your device to a Mac. You can also use iMovie or Final Cut Pro X to edit your previews.\n\nCreating videos for app previews\nCreating App Previews with iMovie\nCreating App Previews with Final Cut Pro X\nSubmitting app previews\n\nLike screenshots, each app preview is device-specific.

    "html": "Optimizing for App Store search\n\nSearch plays a huge role in how users discover and download content on the App Store. Learn how you can impact your search result ranking to help users easily find and download your app, initiate in-app purchases, and learn about in-app events.\n\nOverview\n\nThe App Store makes it easy for people around the world to find apps, games, and content. Search results include developers, in-app purchases, in-app events, categories, editorial stories, tips and tricks, and collections. Apps appear in search results with the app name, icon, and subtitle displayed. Depending on the platform and image orientation, the app’s single rating and up to three screenshots or app previews are also shown.\n\nChoose accurate keywords\n\nKeywords are limited to 100 characters, so be concise when describing your app. While spaces shouldn’t be used before or after the commas that separate keywords and keyword phrases, you can use spaces to separate words within keyword phrases. For example: Property,Real Estate,House.\n\nChoose keywords based on words you think your audience will use to find an app like yours. Be specific when describing your app’s features and functionality to help the search algorithm surface your app in relevant searches.\n\nConsider the trade-off between ranking higher for less common terms versus ranking lower for popular terms. While people may frequently search for terms such as “jobs” or “social,” these terms have highly competitive rankings. More uncommon terms may be searched less often, but aren’t as competitive.\n\nThe unauthorized use of trademarked terms, celebrity names, or other protected words and phrases is not allowed and is a common reason for App Store rejection. The use of terms that aren’t relevant to the app and the use of competing app names are similarly prohibited.\n\nAvoid special characters — such as # or @ — unless they’re part of your brand identity. Special characters don’t carry extra weight in search ranking.\n\nWhile you can repeat keywords in your app description, avoid keyword stuffing throughout your metadata. Also, keep in mind that your promotional text doesn’t affect your app’s search ranking.\n\nSearch ranking\n\nWe’re constantly evolving how search works on the App Store to serve the best results. Search results are ranked based on a number of factors, including:\n\nText relevance. Matches for your app’s title, keywords, and primary category.\n\nUser behavior. Downloads, as well as the quality and quantity of ratings and reviews.\n\nApple Search Ads\n\nUse Apple Search Ads to promote your app across the App Store. Reach people on the Today tab, on the Search tab, at the top of search results, and at the bottom of product pages. Available in 61 regions. Try it for free with a 100 USD credit.*\n\nLearn more\n\n*Eligible developers who sign up for Apple Search Ads will have a 100 credit applied to their new account. Full terms and conditions apply.\n\nCreate a compelling app name, subtitle, and description\n\nYour app’s name and description play a critical role in how people discover and download your app.\n\nNames can be up to 30 characters on the App Store. Choose a simple, memorable name that’s easy to spell and suggests what your app does. Be distinctive — avoid long names full of generic terms or descriptions, or names that are too similar to existing app names.\n\nUse a subtitle, rather than your app’s name, to explain the value of your app in greater detail. Avoid generic descriptions, such as \"world’s best app.\" Instead, highlight your app’s purpose or features that resonate with your audience.\n\nEvery word counts, so focus the description on your app’s unique features and functionality. Begin with a concise statement of what the app does, followed by an attention-grabbing paragraph that includes a short list of main features.\n\nAssign the right categories\n\nCategories on the App Store help people discover new apps to meet their needs. The primary category you select is particularly important for your appʼs discoverability on the App Store, and it helps people find your app when browsing the App Store or filtering search results. The primary category also determines whether your app appears in the Apps tab or Games tab on the App Store. You can also select a secondary category to help our algorithm better surface your app. If you select Games as the primary or secondary category, you can select up to two additional subcategories to define your game.\n\nBe sure to select the categories that are most relevant for your app or game. Choosing categories that aren’t relevant is grounds for rejection by App Review.\n\nLearn about choosing a category\n\nFoster positive ratings\n\nRatings and reviews appear on your product page and influence how your app ranks in search results. They can encourage people to engage with your app, so focus on providing a great app experience that motivates users to leave positive reviews.\n\nAsk users to rate your app on the App Store, but don’t ask too soon — wait until they’ve enjoyed a few sessions first and make sure your app is stable. Then choose an appropriate time to make the request. Look for moments when users are most likely to feel satisfied with your app, such as when they’ve completed an action, level, or task.\n\nProvide an easy way for users to give feedback with the SKStoreReviewController API, which lets them submit a rating through a standardized prompt, as well as write and submit a review — all within your app. You can prompt for ratings up to three times in a 365-day period.\n\nMake sure your support channels and contact information are easy to find in your app and on your App Store product page, so if users encounter difficulties they’re able to discuss them with you directly and resolve negative experiences that may otherwise lead to poor reviews.\n\nLearn about ratings, reviews, and responses\n\nPublish in-app events\n\nIn-app events are timely events within apps and games — such as game competitions, movie premieres, or livestreamed experiences. You can publish your in-app events on the App Store on iOS and iPadOS. When someone searches for an app, the event card and your app appear together in search results for people who have downloaded your app, while screenshots show for those who haven’t downloaded your app. When someone searches for an event, the event card and your app appear together in search results.\n\nLearn about in-app events\n\nPromote in-app purchases\n\nYour promoted in-app purchases appear in search results on the App Store. Tapping an in-app purchase leads to your product page, which displays your app’s description, screenshots, app previews, and in-app events — and lets people initiate an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscriptions and in-app purchases are shown in separate sections on your product page, and you can showcase up to 20 items total. Each item you feature can have a unique display name, promotional image, and description. In-app purchase names are limited to 30 characters and descriptions are limited to 45 characters, so choose your words carefully. Be descriptive, accurate, and concise when highlighting the benefits of your in-app purchases.\n\nLearn about promoting in-app purchases\n\nFinding developers\n\nPeople can search for developers directly on the App Store. Tapping a developer’s name within search results leads to the developer’s page, which highlights their latest release above their entire collection of apps and games.\n\nRelated\nApp Store Review Guidelines\nCreating Your Product Page\nChoosing a Category\nDiscovery on the App Store and Mac App Store\nLocalization\nPromoting Apps with Search Ads"

    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/",
    "html": "Watch the latest videos about privacy \n\nUser privacy and data use\n\nThe App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users to discover apps created by talented developers around the world. Apps on the App Store are held to a high standard for privacy, security, and content because nothing is more important than maintaining users’ trust. In order to submit new apps and app updates, you need to provide information about some of your app’s data collection practices on your product page. You’re required to ask users for their permission to track them across apps and websites owned by other companies.\n\nDescribing data usage Asking permission to track Attributing app installations\nDescribing how your app uses data\n\nThe App Store helps users better understand an app’s privacy practices before they download the app. On each app’s product page, users can learn about some of the data types an app may collect, and whether the information is used to track them or is linked to their identity or device.\n\nIn order to submit new apps and app updates, you must provide information about your privacy practices in App Store Connect. If you use third-party code — such as advertising or analytics SDKs — you need to describe what data the third-party code collects, how the data may be used, and whether the data is used to track users.\n\nLearn more\n\nWhat’s new\n\nAn important part of submitting your app to the App Store is explaining how your app handles user data. Two new updates make it easier to accurately provide Privacy Nutrition Labels and improve the integrity of the software supply chain: signatures for third-party SDKs and privacy manifests. In addition, we’re adding more data type options to use in your Privacy Nutrition Label when describing what types of data your app collects.\n\nRead more\n\nWatch the latest videos\n\nAsking permission to track\n\nIn iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and tvOS 14.5 or later, you need to receive the user’s permission through the AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) framework in order to track them or access their device’s advertising identifier. Tracking refers to the act of linking user or device data collected from your app with user or device data collected from other companies’ apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. Tracking also refers to sharing user or device data with data brokers.\n\nExamples of tracking include, but are not limited to:\n\nDisplaying targeted advertisements in your app based on user data collected from apps and websites owned by other companies.\nSharing device location data or email lists with a data broker.\nSharing a list of emails, advertising IDs, or other IDs with a third-party advertising network that uses that information to retarget those users in other developers’ apps or to find similar users.\nPlacing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency, even if you don’t use the SDK for these purposes. For example, using an analytics SDK that repurposes the data it collects from your app to enable targeted advertising in other developers’ apps.\n\nThe following use cases are not considered tracking, and do not require user permission through the AppTrackingTransparency framework:\n\nWhen user or device data from your app is linked to third-party data solely on the user’s device and is not sent off the device in a way that can identify the user or device.\nWhen the data broker with whom you share data uses the data solely for fraud detection, fraud prevention, or security purposes. For example, using a data broker solely to prevent credit card fraud.\nWhen the data broker is a consumer reporting agency and the data is shared with them for purposes of (1) reporting on a consumer’s creditworthiness, or (2) obtaining information on a consumer’s creditworthiness for the specific purpose of making a credit determination.\nUsing the AppTrackingTransparency framework\n\nTo request permission to track the user and access the device’s advertising identifier, use the AppTrackingTransparency framework. You must also include a purpose string in the system prompt that explains why you’d like to track the user. Unless you receive permission from the user to enable tracking, the device’s advertising identifier value will be all zeros and you may not track them as described above.\n\nWhile you can display the AppTrackingTransparency prompt whenever you choose, the device’s advertising identifier value will only be returned once you present the prompt and the user grants permission. Use the purpose string to explain what this data will be used for to help the user understand what they’re opting in to share. If the user allows apps to request to track, but has turned tracking off for your app, you can ask the user to change their preference for your app by providing a shortcut to Settings where they can change the tracking permission.\n\nThe ID for Vendors (IDFV), may be used for analytics across apps from the same content provider. In this case, the use of the AppTrackingTransparency framework is not required. The IDFV may not be combined with other data to track a user across apps and websites owned by other companies. You remain fully responsible to ensure that your collection and use of the IDFV complies with applicable law.\n\nFor more information, visit:\n\nApp Tracking Transparency\nHuman Interface Guidelines: Privacy\nAdSupport Framework\nFrequently asked questions\nCan I gate functionality on agreeing to allow tracking, or incentivize users to agree to allow tracking in the app tracking transparency prompt?\n\nNo, per the App Review Guidelines: 3.2.2 (vi).\n\nCan I explain to users why I would like permission to track them before I show the tracking permission prompt?\n\nYes, so long as you are transparent to users about your use of the data in your explanation. Per the App Review Guidelines: 5.1.1 (iv), apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access.\n\nIf I have not received permission from a user via the tracking permission prompt, can I use an identifier other than the IDFA (for example, a hashed email address or hashed phone number) to track that user?\n\nNo. You will need to receive the user’s permission through the AppTrackingTransparency framework to track that user.\n\nIf a user provides permission for tracking via a separate process on our website, but declines permission in the app tracking transparency prompt, can I track that user across apps and websites owned by other companies?\n\nDevelopers must get permission via the app tracking transparency prompt for data that’s collected in the app and used for tracking. Data collected separately, outside of the app and not related to the app, is not in scope.\n\nCan I fingerprint or use signals from the device to try to identify the device or a user?\n\nNo. Per the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, you may not derive data from a device for the purpose of uniquely identifying it. Examples of user or device data include, but are not limited to: properties of a user’s web browser and its configuration, the user’s device and its configuration, the user’s location, or the user’s network connection. Apps that are found to be engaging in this practice, or that reference SDKs (including but not limited to Ad Networks, Attribution services, and Analytics) that are, may be rejected from the App Store.\n\nIf I share data with a consumer reporting agency to conduct fraud checks, and separately share data with them as part of a credit check or for credit reporting purposes, do I need permission to track?\n\nNo. You do not need permission from the user when a data broker uses the data shared with them solely for fraud detection or prevention or security purposes. You also do not need permission from the user when sharing data with a consumer reporting agency and the data is shared with them for purposes of (1) reporting on a consumer’s creditworthiness, or (2) obtaining information on a consumer’s creditworthiness for the specific purpose of making a credit determination.\n\nDo I need to use the AppTrackingTransparency framework to get user permission to use third-party deep-linking or deferred deep-linking tools?\n\nYes. If your application uses any third-party services that pass unique identifiers or create a shared identity of the user between applications from different companies for ad targeting, ad measurement, or sharing with a data broker, your app will need to request permission from the user using the AppTrackingTransparency framework.\n\nI have integrated an SDK from another company. Am I responsible for the data collection and tracking of users of my app by that company?\n\nYes. Developers are responsible for all code included in their apps. If you are unsure about the data collection and tracking practices of code used in your app that you didn’t write, we suggest contacting the developer of the SDK.\n\nI have integrated single sign-on functionality provided by another company. Am I responsible for the data collection and tracking practices of that company?\n\nYes. Developers are responsible for all code included in their app, including single sign-on (SSO) functionality provided by third parties. If the user will be subject to tracking as a result of SSO functionality included in your app, you must use the app tracking transparency prompt to obtain permission from that user first.\n\nWhat kind of company constitutes a data broker?\n\nData brokers are defined by law in some jurisdictions. In general, a data broker is a company that regularly collects and sells, licenses, or otherwise discloses to third parties the personal information of particular end-users with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.\n\nWhat identifiers or data are governed by the “tracking” policy?\n\nAny user or device level identifier that is used to join data from your app with data from third parties (including SDKs used in your app) for purposes of advertising or ad measurement or sharing with a data broker. This includes, but is not limited to, the device’s advertising identifier, session ID, fingerprint IDs, and device graph identifiers. If your app receives or shares any of these identifiers for the above listed purposes, you must use the AppTrackingTransparency framework to obtain user consent.\n\nIf tracking occurs within a webview inside an app, do I need to use the AppTrackingTransparency prompt?\n\nYes. If you are using a webview for app functionality, it should be treated the same way as native functionality in your app, unless you are enabling the user to navigate the open web.\n\nWhat OS versions require AppTrackingTransparency permission to access the value of the IDFA?\n\nTo access the value of the IDFA for users on iOS/iPadOS version 14.5 or later, you will first need to receive permission from the user through the AppTrackingTransparency prompt. For additional guidance on tracking, please refer to App Review Guidelines: 5.1.1 (iv).\n\nCan I add other permission requests in order to comply with regulations, such as ePrivacy or GDPR?\n\nYes, you can choose to include screens in order to comply with government regulations. However, your app must always respect the user’s response to the AppTrackingTransparency prompt, even if their response to other prompts conflicts. Guideline 5.1.1 (iv) states: “Apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access.” This includes altering a user’s AppTrackingTransparency response by only respecting their response to other permission requests. You can use third-party Consent Management Platforms to add these permission requests, as long as no tracking takes place from such use. You remain fully responsible to ensure that your collection and use of information linked to users’ identity or to their device, including information used to track users, complies with applicable law.\n\nCan I offer a control in my app, separate from ATT, to comply with local privacy laws?\n\nYes. When offering a separate control to comply with local privacy laws, please consider the following:\n\nDon’t confuse the user. Be clear that the control doesn’t override their previous ATT choice.\nProvide context. If possible, show the user’s ATT status as part of a separate control so they can understand the choices they've already made.\nBe clear about what the choice is. If the user has not granted ATT permission, and there is no additional data use beyond the scope of ATT, be clear that no further action is required. If the user has granted ATT permission, it should be clear what impact the separate control will have on their ATT choice.\nAttributing app installations\n\nAdvertisers can use AdAttributionKit — Apple’s privacy-preserving, industry-leading technology — to attribute in-app ad campaigns and web ads on mobile, while maintaining user privacy.\n\nLearn more"

    "html": "Ratings, reviews, and responses\n\nCustomers provide ratings and reviews on the App Store to give feedback on their experience with an app and help others decide which apps they’d like to try. You can ask for ratings and respond to reviews to improve your app’s discoverability, encourage downloads, and build rapport with people who use your app.\n\nRatings\n\nUsers can rate your app on a scale of one to five stars. Individual ratings inform your app’s summary rating, which is displayed on your product page and in search results. This summary rating is specific to each territory on the App Store and you can reset it when you release a new version of your app. However, we recommend using this feature sparingly. While resetting the summary rating can ensure that it reflects the most current version of your app — which can be useful if an update addresses users’ previous concerns — having few ratings may discourage potential users from downloading your app. In addition, keep in mind that resetting your summary rating won’t reset your app’s written reviews. Users can rate iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, and tvOS apps on the appʼs product page on their device, and they can rate watchOS apps on the appʼs product page on their iOS device.\n\nReviews\n\nWritten reviews allow users to share more detail about their experience with an app. Users can review iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS apps on the app’s product page on their device, and review watchOS apps on their iOS device. If you choose to reset your summary rating, past reviews will continue to display on the product page.\n\nAsking for ratings and reviews\n\nYou can ask users to rate and review your app at appropriate times throughout the user experience. Make the request when users are most likely to feel satisfaction with your app, such as when they’ve completed an action, level, or task. Make sure not to interrupt their activity.\n\nThe SKStoreReviewController API lets you give users an easy way to provide feedback about your app. You can prompt for ratings up to three times in a 365-day period. Users will submit a rating through the standardized prompt, and can write and submit a review without leaving the app.\n\nEnsure that your support contact information is easy to find in your app and on your App Store product page. This gives users a direct way to reach you if they encounter difficulties, and gives you an opportunity to resolve negative experiences that may otherwise lead to poor reviews.\n\nBest practices and guidelines\n\nGet details on best practices for asking for ratings and reviews in the Human Interface Guidelines. For guidelines on responding to customer reviews, see the Safety section of the App Review Guidelines.\n\nManaging reviews and responses\n\nApp Store Connect users with an Admin or Customer Support role can view, sort, and respond to reviews. Learn more\n\nResponding to reviews on the App Store\n\nAddressing feedback directly on your App Store product page can help you create a better user experience and improve your app’s rating. You can respond to all reviews of your app, regardless of when they were written, in App Store Connect. When you respond, the reviewer is notified and has the option to update their review. You can edit your response at any time, and only the latest version of your response will be shown.\n\nThe ideal response is concise and clearly addresses your customer’s feedback. Keep your responses respectful and don’t include personal information, marketing language, or spam. Strive for a friendly tone that’s consistent with the voice of your brand. When possible, we recommend personalizing your responses rather than using generic responses for similar reviews.\n\nIf you can’t respond to every review, consider prioritizing reviews with the lowest star ratings or those mentioning technical issues with the current version of your app. Clearly acknowledge the reviewer’s feedback, and let them know you’re working on addressing the issue.\n\nWhen you release an app update that fixes issues mentioned in older reviews, include this information in your release notes and consider replying to relevant reviews to tell these users about the fix. This can be an effective method for reengaging previously dissatisfied users.\n\nConsider promptly replying to new and updated reviews following a major release of your app so that you can have a dialogue with users when they’re most interested in sharing feedback. You can set up email alerts in the Users and Roles section of App Store Connect to notify you when a user edits a review to which you’ve previously replied.\n\nWhen to direct users to Apple Support\n\nIf a reviewer reports a downloading error or billing issue, direct them to Apple Support. If Apple determines that the issue is not related to the App Store or the user’s account, we’ll contact you.\n\nReporting concerns\n\nIf you see a review that contains offensive material, spam, or other content that violates Apple’s Terms and Conditions, use the Report a Concern option under the review in App Store Connect instead of replying to the review. The user who wrote the review will not be notified that you reported a concern.\n\nUsing customer ratings and reviews\n\nYou may use your app’s rating in marketing materials as long as it accurately reflects your app’s current rating. Customer reviews may be used in marketing materials only if permission from the reviewer is granted.\n\nRelated\nRatings and reviews: Human Interface Guidelines\nMonitor ratings and reviews: App Store Connect Help\nReview API Reference"

This information is required to submit new apps and app updates to the App Store.\n\nWhat’s new\nAnswering questions\nData collection\nOptional disclosure\nTypes of data\nData use\nData linked to the user\nTracking\nPrivacy links\nAdditional guidance\nWhat’s new\n\nAn important part of submitting your app to the App Store is explaining how your app handles user data. Two new updates make it easier to accurately provide Privacy Nutrition Labels and improve the integrity of the software supply chain: signatures for third-party SDKs and privacy manifests. In addition, we’re adding more data type options to use in your Privacy Nutrition Label when describing what types of data your app collects.\n\nRead more\n\nWatch the latest videos\n\nAnswering app privacy questions\n\nAs you get ready to select your answers from the options presented in App Store Connect, keep in mind:\n\nYou need to identify all of the data you or your third-party partners collect, unless the data meets all of the criteria for optional disclosure listed below.\nYour app’s privacy practices should follow the App Review Guidelines and all applicable laws.\nYou’re responsible for keeping your responses accurate and up to date. If your practices change, update your responses in App Store Connect. You may update your answers at any time, and you do not need to submit an app update in order to change your answers.\n\nAccount Holders, Admins, and App Managers can learn how to enter their responses in App Store Connect.\n\nData collection\n\nThe purpose of the label is to help your customers understand what data is collected from your app and how it is used. To complete that, you’ll need to know the types of data that you and/or your third-party partners collect from your app before answering the questions in App Store Connect. Keep in mind that even if you collect the data for reasons other than analytics or advertising, it still needs to be declared. For example, if you collect data solely for the purpose of app functionality, declare the data on your label and indicate that it is only being used for that purpose.\n\n“Collect” refers to transmitting data off the device in a way that allows you and/or your third-party partners to access it for a period longer than what is necessary to service the transmitted request in real time.\n\n“Third-party partners” refers to analytics tools, advertising networks, third-party SDKs, or other external vendors whose code you’ve added to your app.\n\nOptional disclosure\n\nData types that meet all of the following criteria are optional to disclose:\n\nThe data is not used for tracking purposes, meaning the data is not linked with Third-Party Data for advertising or advertising measurement purposes, or shared with a data broker. For details, see the Tracking section.\nThe data is not used for Third-Party Advertising, your Advertising or Marketing purposes, or for Other Purposes, as those terms are defined in the Tracking section.\nCollection of the data occurs only in infrequent cases that are not part of your app’s primary functionality, and which are optional for the user.\nThe data is provided by the user in your app’s interface, it is clear to the user what data is collected, the user’s name or account name is prominently displayed in the submission form alongside the other data elements being submitted, and the user affirmatively chooses to provide the data for collection each time.\n\nData types must meet all criteria in order to be considered optional for disclosure. If a data type collected by your app meets some, but not all, of the above criteria, it must be disclosed in App Store Connect.\n\nExamples of data that may not need to be disclosed include data collected in optional feedback forms or customer service requests that are unrelated to the primary purpose of the app and meet the other criteria above.\n\nFor the purpose of clarity, data collected on an ongoing basis after an initial request for permission must be disclosed.\n\nRegulated Financial Services Disclosure\n\nData types that are collected by an app that facilitates regulated financial services and where the data collected meets all of the following criteria are optional to disclose:\n\nCollection of the regulated data is in accordance with a legally required privacy notice under applicable financial services or data protection laws or regulations (e.g., GDPR or GLBA).\nCollection by the app of that data occurs only in cases that are not part of your app’s primary functionality, and which are optional for the user.\nSuch notice provides that data is not shared with unaffiliated third parties to market other products and services.\nSuch data is not linked with third-party data for advertising purposes or shared with a data broker except for purposes of fraud detection or prevention or security purposes, or with a consumer reporting agency for credit reporting.\n\nData types must meet all criteria in order to be considered optional for disclosure. If a data type collected by your app meets some, but not all, of the above criteria, it must be disclosed in your privacy section.\n\nHealth Research Disclosure\n\nData types that are collected as part of a health research study and where the data collected meets all of the following criteria are optional to disclose:\n\nThe data is collected by an entity whose collection of the data is subject to an informed consent form (ICF) as part of a health research study that has been reviewed and approved by an institutional review board or ethics review board.\nAll such data collection must follow the relevant App Review Guidelines and the data may not be used for tracking purposes.\n\nIf the data type collected by your app meets some, but not all, of the above criteria, it must be disclosed in your privacy section.\n\nTypes of data\n\nRefer to the list of data types below and compare them to the data collection practices in your app.\n\nContact Info\nName\tSuch as first or last name\nEmail Address\tIncluding but not limited to a hashed email address\nPhone Number\tIncluding but not limited to a hashed phone number\nPhysical Address\tSuch as home address, physical address, or mailing address\nOther User Contact Info\tAny other information that can be used to contact the user outside the app\nHealth & Fitness\nHealth\tHealth and medical data, including but not limited to data from the Clinical Health Records API, HealthKit API, Movement Disorder API, or health-related human subject research or any other user provided health or medical data\nFitness\tFitness and exercise data, including but not limited to the Motion and Fitness API\nFinancial Info\nPayment Info\tSuch as form of payment, payment card number, or bank account number. If your app uses a payment service, the payment information is entered outside your app, and you as the developer never have access to the payment information, it is not collected and does not need to be disclosed.\nCredit Info\tSuch as credit score\nOther Financial Info\tSuch as salary, income, assets, debts, or any other financial information\nLocation\nPrecise Location\tInformation that describes the location of a user or device with the same or greater resolution as a latitude and longitude with three or more decimal places\nCoarse Location\tInformation that describes the location of a user or device with lower resolution than a latitude and longitude with three or more decimal places, such as Approximate Location Services\nSensitive Info\nSensitive Info\tSuch as racial or ethnic data, sexual orientation, pregnancy or childbirth information, disability, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, political opinion, genetic information, or biometric data\nContacts\nContacts\tSuch as a list of contacts in the user’s phone, address book, or social graph\nUser Content\nEmails or Text Messages\tIncluding subject line, sender, recipients, and contents of the email or message\nPhotos or Videos\tThe user’s photos or videos\nAudio Data\tThe user’s voice or sound recordings\nGameplay Content\tSuch as saved games, multiplayer matching or gameplay logic, or user-generated content in-game\nCustomer Support\tData generated by the user during a customer support request\nOther User Content\tAny other user-generated content\nBrowsing History\nBrowsing History\tInformation about content the user has viewed that is not part of the app, such as websites\nSearch History\nSearch History\tInformation about searches performed in the app\nIdentifiers\nUser ID\tSuch as screen name, handle, account ID, assigned user ID, customer number, or other user- or account-level ID that can be used to identify a particular user or account\nDevice ID\tSuch as the device’s advertising identifier, or other device-level ID\nPurchases\nPurchase History\tAn account’s or individual’s purchases or purchase tendencies\nUsage Data\nProduct Interaction\tSuch as app launches, taps, clicks, scrolling information, music listening data, video views, saved place in a game, video, or song, or other information about how the user interacts with the app\nAdvertising Data\tSuch as information about the advertisements the user has seen\nOther Usage Data\tAny other data about user activity in the app\nDiagnostics\nCrash Data\tSuch as crash logs\nPerformance Data\tSuch as launch time, hang rate, or energy use\nOther Diagnostic Data\tAny other data collected for the purposes of measuring technical diagnostics related to the app\nSurroundings\nEnvironment Scanning\tSuch as mesh, planes, scene classification, and/or image detection of the user’s surroundings\nBody\nHands\tThe user’s hand structure and hand movements\nHead\tThe user’s head movement\nOther Data\nOther Data Types\tAny other data types not mentioned\nData use\n\nYou should have a clear understanding of how each data type is used by you and your third-party partners.\n\nFor example, collecting an email address and using it to authenticate the user and personalize the user’s experience within your app would include App Functionality and Product Personalization.\n\nPurpose\tDefinition\nThird-Party Advertising\tSuch as displaying third-party ads in your app, or sharing data with entities who display third-party ads\nDeveloper’s Advertising or Marketing\tSuch as displaying first-party ads in your app, sending marketing communications directly to your users, or sharing data with entities who will display your ads\nAnalytics\tUsing data to evaluate user behavior, including to understand the effectiveness of existing product features, plan new features, or measure audience size or characteristics\nProduct Personalization\tCustomizing what the user sees, such as a list of recommended products, posts, or suggestions\nApp Functionality\tSuch as to authenticate the user, enable features, prevent fraud, implement security measures, ensure server up-time, minimize app crashes, improve scalability and performance, or perform customer support\nOther Purposes\tAny other purposes not listed\nData linked to the user\n\nYou’ll need to identify whether each data type is linked to the user’s identity (via their account, device, or other details) by you and/or your third-party partners. Data collected from an app is often linked to the user’s identity, unless specific privacy protections are put in place before collection to de-identify or anonymize it, such as:\n\nStripping data of any direct identifiers, such as user ID or name, before collection.\nManipulating data to break the linkage and prevent re-linkage to real-world identities.\n\nAdditionally, in order for data not to be linked to a particular user’s identity, you must avoid certain activities after collection:\n\nYou must not attempt to link the data back to the user’s identity.\nYou must not tie the data to other datasets that enable it to be linked to a particular user’s identity.\n\nNote: “Personal Information” and “Personal Data”, as defined under relevant privacy laws, are considered linked to the user.\n\nTracking\n\nYou’ll need to understand whether you and/or your third-party partners use data from your app to track users and, if so, which data is used for this purpose.\n\n“Tracking” refers to linking data collected from your app about a particular end-user or device, such as a user ID, device ID, or profile, with Third-Party Data for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, or sharing data collected from your app about a particular end-user or device with a data broker.\n\n“Third-Party Data” refers to any data about a particular end-user or device collected from apps, websites, or offline properties not owned by you.\n\nExamples of tracking include:\n\nDisplaying targeted advertisements in your app based on user data collected from apps and websites owned by other companies.\nSharing device location data or email lists with a data broker.\nSharing a list of emails, advertising IDs, or other IDs with a third-party advertising network that uses that information to retarget those users in other developers’ apps or to find similar users.\nPlacing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency, even if you don’t use the SDK for these purposes. For example, using a login SDK that repurposes the data it collects from your app to enable targeted advertising in other developers’ apps.\n\nThe following situations are not considered tracking:\n\nWhen the data is linked solely on the end-user’s device and is not sent off the device in a way that can identify the end-user or device.\nWhen the data broker uses the data shared with them solely for fraud detection or prevention or security purposes.\nWhen the data broker is a consumer reporting agency and the data is shared with them for purposes of (1) reporting on a consumer’s creditworthiness or (2) obtaining information on a consumer’s creditworthiness for the specific purpose of making a credit determination.\n\nLearn more about tracking.\n\nPrivacy links\n\nBy adding the following links on your product page, you can help users easily access your app’s privacy policy and manage their data in your app.\n\nPrivacy Policy (Required): The URL to your publicly accessible privacy policy.\n\nPrivacy Choices (Optional): A publicly accessible URL where users can learn more about their privacy choices for your app and how to manage them. For example, a webpage where users can access their data, request deletion, or make changes.\n\nAdditional guidance\nYour app has web views.\n\nData collected via web traffic must be declared, unless you are enabling the user to navigate the open web.\n\nYou collect and store IP address from your users.\n\nDeclare the relevant data types based on how you use IP address, such as precise location, coarse location, device ID, or diagnostics.\n\nYou offer in-app private messaging between users that are not SMS text messages.\n\nDeclare emails or text messages on your label. Text messages refer to both SMS and non-SMS messages.\n\nYour app includes game saves, multiplayer matching, or gameplay logic.\n\nDeclare Gameplay Content on your label.\n\nYou collect different types of data from users depending on whether the user is a child, whether they are a free or paid user, whether they opt in, where they live, or for some other reason.\n\nPlease disclose all data collected from your app, unless it meets all of the criteria outlined in the Optional Disclosure section. You may use the Privacy Choices or Privacy Policy links to provide additional detail about how your data collection practices may vary.\n\nYou use Apple frameworks or services, such as MapKit, CloudKit, or App Analytics.\n\nIf you collect data about your app from Apple frameworks or services, you should indicate what data you collect and how you use it. You are not responsible for disclosing data collected by Apple.\n\nYou use location, device identifiers, and other sensitive data, but only on device, and the data is never sent to a server.\n\nData that is processed only on device is not “collected” and does not need to be disclosed in your answers. If you derive anything from that data and send it off device, the resulting data should be considered separately.\n\nYou collect precise location, but immediately de-identify and coarsen it before storing.\n\nDisclose that you collect Coarse Location, since the precise location data is immediately coarsened and precise location is not stored.\n\nYour app includes free-form text fields or voice recordings, and users can save any type of information they want through those mediums, including names and health data.\n\nMark \"Other User Content\" to represent generic free form text fields and \"Audio Data\" for voice recordings. You’re not responsible for disclosing all possible data that users may manually enter in the app through free-form fields or voice recordings. However, if you ask a user to input a specific data type into a text field, such as their name or email, or if you have a feature that enables users to upload a particular media type, such as photos or videos, then you’ll need to disclose the specific type of data.\n\nYou collect data to service a request but do not retain it after servicing the request.\n\n\"Collect\" refers to transmitting data off the device and storing it in a readable form for longer than the time it takes you and/or your third-party partners to service the request. For example, if an authentication token or IP address is sent on a server call and not retained, or if data is sent to your servers then immediately discarded after servicing the request, you do not need to disclose this in your answers in App Store Connect."

    "html": "Measuring app performance\n\nBy understanding how users discover and interact with your app, you can create even better app experiences that help grow your business. Get valuable data you won’t find anywhere else in App Analytics, Sales and Trends, and Payments and Financial Reports within App Store Connect.\n\nUser acquisition in App Analytics\n\nMeasure your app downloads, App Store conversion rate, marketing campaigns for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS apps.\n\nApp downloads\n\nFind out how many times your app has been downloaded — and get breakouts by territory, device, and source — by viewing Total Downloads. This metric includes First-Time Downloads of your app as well as Redownloads.\n\nWhen a user downloads your app to their device for the first time, it’s counted as a First-Time Download. App Analytics provides a general view of your First-Time Downloads, as well as breakouts by territory, device, and source. To view data over a specific time period, select a custom date range.\n\nA Redownload occurs when a user who previously downloaded your app adds it to their device again. To view the number of redownloads, visit the Metrics tab and click Redownloads in the pop-up menu.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of where your downloads came from, click the Sources tab and choose a download type from the pop-up menu. A source is counted when a customer follows a link to your App Store product page. There are five types of sources: App Store Browse, App Store Search, App Referrers, Web Referrers, and App Clips. For details on App Referrers or Web Referrers, choose the corresponding source in the pop-up menu. Learn about measuring user acquisition sources in App Store Connect Help.\n\nApp Store conversion rate\n\nThe conversion rate helps you understand how often people download your app after viewing it on the App Store. In App Analytics, this is measured as the ratio of Total Downloads to Unique Impressions. Total Downloads can include first-time downloads redownloads and pre-orders. A Unique Impression is counted when a customer views your app on the Today, Games, Apps, or Search tabs on the App Store, or on your product page. For example, if your app has 100 Unique Impressions and 50 Total Downloads, your conversion rate is 50%. To quickly view your conversion rate, click the Metrics tab and select Conversion Rate from the pop-up menu. View this data by Source Type to understand which sources result in the highest conversion rate, or filter by an individual source for more detail. You can use this information to measure performance over time and understand how changes to your product page affect your conversion rate.\n\nCampaign performance\n\nCampaign links take the user to your App Store product page, and allow you to measure the performance of each of your marketing channels (e.g., website, social media, email, paid advertising, cross-promotion in other apps). Make links for different versions of your marketing creative — such as advertisements with different copy, calls to action, icons, characters, or screenshots — to learn which results in more downloads. If certain elements used in your campaign result in better conversion, you might choose to also use them on your App Store product page. You can also measure downloads from Smart App Banners in Safari or cross-promotions in apps that use StoreKit to display your product page.\n\nTo understand how your campaigns are performing, click the Sources tab and click Campaigns to view data for Impressions, Total Downloads, Sales, and Sessions for each campaign link you’ve created. Click the name of a campaign for additional details. View the conversion rate of individual campaigns by clicking the Metrics tab, selecting Conversion Rate under Saved Views, and viewing by Campaign. For more information on generating campaign links and measuring promotions, view Manage campaigns in App Store Connect Help.\n\nPre-orders\n\nYou can allow customers to pre-order your app before its release date and have it automatically download once it’s available. If you’ve published your app as pre-order, the Overview page displays the number of current Pre-Orders for your selected app. Once your app is available on the App Store, you can view how many downloads and sales you received from customers who pre-ordered your app. You can also view the number of times a pre-order was placed, cancelled, and fulfilled in the Pre-Orders section of Sales and Trends. To learn more about making your app available for pre-order, view Offering your apps for pre-order.\n\nUser engagement in App Analytics\n\nMeasure app usage — including active devices, sessions, and retention — as well as user acquisition sources for your iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS apps. Usage data includes only users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with you. For information about subscriber retention, view Measuring performance with Sales and Trends.\n\nActive devices and sessions\n\nA Session is counted when your app is used for at least two seconds, and Active Devices are those with at least one session during a given period. On the Overview page, you can see the number of Sessions per Active Device and click the number for details. This can help you understand typical engagement with your app and measure progress toward usage goals. You can also view or filter this data by different dimensions for additional insight. For example:\n\nFilter by Campaign to see which are most effective at acquiring more engaged users.\nView by Territory to discover whether users in particular regions engage more often with your app. If a territory has a low ratio of Sessions per Active Device, consider contributing factors — such as quality of localization, clarity of onboarding, or regional differences in the use of features — and identify ways to improve the experience and encourage feature use.\nFilter by Device to learn if users who access your app on a particular device are more engaged than others. This can help you understand if it’s beneficial to optimize your apps for a particular device type first.\n1, 3\n2\nRetention rate\n\nThe Retention tab shows the percentage of devices on which your app was used in the days after first installation. This can help you understand whether users enjoy their initial app experience. If your retention rate is low, you might update your onboarding experience to help users better understand your app and see if retention rates improve. You can also filter this data by different dimensions for additional insight. For example:\n\nFilter by App Version and look at the Daily Retention table to see if retention rates improved since previous versions.\nFilter by Source Type or Campaign and look at the Daily Retention table to see retention rates based on acquisition source or campaign.\n1, 2\nProceeds per paying user\n\nA paying user is a unique user, based on Apple ID, who paid for an app or in-app purchases. To see proceeds per paying user, choose Proceeds in the Metrics tab and compare this data to Paying Users. Look for variation in this data for different versions of your app to understand if your updates might have affected user spending. You can also filter this data by different dimensions for more insight. For example:\n\nView by Territory to learn which territories have the highest ratio of proceeds per paying users. Users in these areas might be more likely to buy your app or in-app purchases.\nFilter by Source Type, such as App Referrer, to understand if a particular source brings in more paying users to your app than other sources.\n1\n2\nMonetization and business performance in Sales and Trends\n\nMeasure the daily performance of your apps and in-app purchases on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS. Data is recorded when a customer initiates a transaction on the App Store or in your app. Note that data for iMessage apps and sticker packs is associated with iOS.\n\nTo learn more, see the following resources:\n\nAbout Sales and Trends\nSales and Trends metrics and dimensions\nMeasuring subscription performance with Sales and Trends\nAutomate your workflow with the App Store Connect API\nIn-app purchases\n\nIn-app purchases include consumables, non-consumables, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewing subscriptions. To see a high-level summary of your in-app purchases, visit the Overview page and look at the In-App Purchases section. You’ll see the number of in-app purchases made across all of your apps during the 30 days leading up to the selected date.\n\nRestored in-app purchases are not included. For more detailed information, click Top In-App Purchases to visit the Units page filtered by in-app purchases. You can view or filter this data by different dimensions for additional insight. For example:\n\nView by Territory to understand where the most in-app purchases were initiated. This can help you measure the growth of newly launched in-app purchases.\nFilter by Content, then enter the name or Apple ID of a specific in-app purchase to see data on its performance.\nFilter by Parent App for a breakdown of in-app purchases associated with that app, including which are most popular.\n1\n2, 3\nSales\n\nOn the Overview page, visit the Sales section to see your total sales across all apps, in-app purchases, and bundles you offer, including applicable taxes. Sales are estimated in USD based on a rolling average of the previous month’s exchange rates. Refunds subtract from the total. Please note that sales totals are recorded when a customer initiates a transaction, not when Apple has successfully billed and collected payment from the user.\n\nTo view a breakdown of your sales by content type, visit the Sales page. You’ll see your total sales for the selected timeframe, as well as the percent change from the previous timeframe (for example, this month’s sales compared to last month’s sales). You can also see a graph of sales per day. Filter or view this data by different dimensions for more details. For example:\n\nFilter by Content Type to see which apps and in-app purchases have the most sales. Sales data for a specific app includes the sales of all consumables offered in the app.\nView by Territory to see which areas generate the most sales over time. Click on a specific territory to see a summary of its sales and a comparison to the previous timeframe. You can also get this information by filtering by Territory and choosing specific territories.\n1\n2\nFinal proceeds in Payments and Financial Reports\n\nView your total monthly proceeds and total Units sold, as well as payment details by territory. This information can be manually downloaded as a monthly report by clicking the Create Reports button, or automatically downloaded using Reporter or the App Store Connect API. Proceeds are dispersed in your bank account’s currency.\n\nIf payment has not yet been transferred to your bank, you’ll see Total Estimated Proceeds at the top of the page. Please note the amount you receive may vary due to changes in foreign exchange rate at the time of payment and any applicable withholding tax, which will be applied when the payment is made.\n\nIf payment has been transferred to your bank, you’ll see Total Proceeds at the top of the page, which reflects the final proceeds paid for the corresponding region and reporting period.\n\nTo learn more, view Getting paid in App Store Connect Help."

    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page/",
    "html": "You can now take advantage of product page optimization, and create custom product pages on the App Store.\n\nCreating your product page\n\nEvery element of your App Store product page has the power to drive downloads of your app. Learn how to help customers discover your app and engage them through thoughtfully crafted metadata on your product page and in search results. You can build and maintain your product page in App Store Connect or automate your workflow with the App Store Connect API.\n\nApp name\n\nYour app’s name plays a critical role in how users discover it on the App Store. Choose a simple, memorable name that is easy to spell and hints at what your app does. Be distinctive. Avoid names that use generic terms or are too similar to existing app names. An app name can be up to 30 characters long.\n\nApp Name\nIcon\n\nYour app icon is one of the first elements of your app that users see, so it’s essential to make a strong first impression that communicates your app’s quality and purpose. Work with a graphic designer to create an icon that is simple and recognizable. Try testing different options to determine which icon is the most recognizable and meaningful to your target audience.\n\nTo ensure the icon is legible in all sizes, avoid adding unnecessary visual details. For information about creating a beautiful and memorable icon, see the Human Interface Guidelines.\n\nIcon\nSubtitle\n\nYour app’s subtitle is intended to summarize your app in a concise phrase. Consider using this, rather than your app’s name, to explain the value of your app in greater detail. Avoid generic descriptions such as “world’s best app.” Instead, highlight features or typical uses of your app that resonate with your audience. You can update your subtitle when submitting a new version of your app to help you determine the subtitle that’s most effective for engaging users. A subtitle can be up to 30 characters long and appears below your app’s name throughout the App Store.\n\nSubtitle\nApp previews\n\nAn app preview demonstrates the features, functionality, and UI of your app in a short video that users watch directly on the App Store. Previews can be up to 30 seconds long and use footage captured on the device to show the experience of using your app. You can feature up to three app previews on your App Store and Mac App Store product pages, and localize them for all available App Store languages.\n\nApp previews autoplay with muted audio when users view your product page, so make sure the first few seconds of your video are visually compelling. App preview poster frames appear whenever videos do not autoplay.\n\nTo learn about creating great app previews, see Show More with App Previews.\n\nApp Preview\nScreenshots\n\nUse images captured from your app’s UI to visually communicate your app’s user experience. You can feature up to 10 screenshots on your App Store and Mac App Store product pages. Depending on the orientation of your screenshots, the first one to three images will appear in search results when no app preview is available, so make sure these highlight the essence of your app. Focus each subsequent screenshot on a main benefit or feature so that you fully convey your app’s value. If your app supports Dark Mode, consider including at least one screenshot that showcases what the experience looks like for users.\n\nFor screenshot specifications, see App Store Connect Help.\n\nScreenshot\nDescription\n\nProvide an engaging description that highlights the features and functionality of your app. The ideal description is a concise, informative paragraph followed by a short list of main features. Let potential users know what makes your app unique and why they’ll love it. Communicate in the tone of your brand, and use terminology your target audience will appreciate and understand. The first sentence of your description is the most important — this is what users can read without having to tap to read more. Every word counts, so focus on your app’s unique features.\n\nIf you choose to mention an accolade, we recommend putting it at the end of your description or as part of your promotional text. Don’t add unnecessary keywords to your description in an attempt to improve search results. Also avoid including specific prices in your app description. Pricing is already shown on the product page, and references within the description may not be accurate in all regions.\n\nYou can update your app’s description when you submit a new version of your app. If you want to share important updates more frequently, consider using your promotional text instead.\n\nPromotional text\n\nYour app’s promotional text appears at the top of the description and is up to 170 characters long. You can update promotional text at any time without having to submit a new version of your app. Consider using this to share the latest news about your app, such as limited-time sales or upcoming features.\n\nDescription\nKeywords\n\nKeywords help determine where your app displays in search results, so choose them carefully to ensure your app is easily discoverable. Choose keywords based on words you think your audience will use to find an app like yours. Be specific when describing your app’s features and functionality to help the search algorithm surface your app in relevant searches. Consider the trade-off between ranking well for less common terms versus ranking lower for popular terms. Popular, functional terms, such as “jobs” or “social”, may drive a lot of traffic, but are highly competitive in the rankings. Less common terms drive lower traffic, but are less competitive.\n\nKeywords are limited to 100 characters total, with terms separated by commas and no spaces. (Note that you can use spaces to separate words within keyword phrases. For example: Property,House,Real Estate.) Maximize the number of words that fit in this character limit by avoiding the following:\n\nPlurals of words that you’ve already included in singular form\nNames of categories or the word “app”\nDuplicate words\nSpecial characters — such as # or @ — unless they’re part of your brand identity. Special characters don’t carry extra weight when users search for your app.\n\nImproper use of keywords is a common reason for App Store rejections. Do not use the following in your keywords:\n\nUnauthorized use of trademarked terms, celebrity names, and other protected words and phrases\nTerms that are not relevant to the app\nCompeting app names\nIrrelevant, inappropriate, offensive, or objectionable terms\n\nIn addition, keep in mind that promotional text doesn’t affect your app’s search ranking so it should not be used to display keywords.\n\nIn-app purchases\n\nUsers can view and start an in-app purchase from your product page. In-app purchases and subscriptions are shown in two separate sections on your product page, and you can showcase up to 20 total items across both of these sections. You can even choose the order in which to list them to help drive awareness for specific content. Each item has its own display name, promotional image, and description. In-app purchase names are limited to 30 characters and descriptions are limited to 45 characters, so be descriptive, accurate, and concise when highlighting their benefits.\n\nIn-app purchases can also appear in search results and be featured on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs. When users tap on an in-app purchase in these locations, they are taken to your product page where they can read your app’s description, view screenshots and app previews, or start the in-app purchase. If they don’t have your app installed on their device when they start the in-app purchase, they’ll be prompted to download or purchase the app to complete the transaction.\n\nFor details, see Promoting Your In-App Purchases.\n\nIn-App Purchase\nWhat’s New\n\nWhen you update your app, you can use What’s New to communicate changes to users. This text appears on your product page and on the Updates tab.\n\nIf you added a feature or fixed a bug based on feedback, use What’s New to let users know that you’ve listened to them. List new features, content, or functionality in order of importance, and add call-to-action messaging that gets users excited about the update.\n\nWhat’s New\nRatings and reviews\n\nRatings and reviews influence how your app ranks in search and can encourage users to engage with your app from search results, so focus on providing a great app experience that motivates users to leave positive reviews. Individual ratings inform your app’s summary rating, which is displayed on your product page and in search results. This summary rating is specific to each territory on the App Store.\n\nThe SKStoreReviewController API lets you give users an easy way to provide feedback about your app. You can prompt for ratings up to three times in a 365-day period. Users will submit a rating through the standardized prompt, and can write and submit a review without leaving the app.\n\nYou can use App Store Connect to respond to customer reviews of your app to directly address their feedback, questions, and concerns. When you respond, the reviewer will be notified and will have the option to update their review. Reviews and responses can be updated at any time, but only the latest review and response for each user will display on your product page.\n\nFor details, see Ratings, Reviews, and Responses.\n\nCategories\n\nCategories on the App Store help users discover new apps to meet their needs. You can assign a primary and a secondary category to your app. The primary category is particularly important for discoverability, as it helps users find your app when browsing or filtering search results, and it determines in which tab your app appears on the App Store. Be sure to select the primary category that’s most relevant. Choosing categories that are not relevant to your app may cause your app to be rejected when submitted for review.\n\nFor details, see Choosing a Category.\n\nLocalization\n\nIf your app is available in multiple languages, make sure to localize your app description, keywords, app previews, and screenshots, for each of the markets in which you offer your app. You can also translate your app’s name and tailor your keywords to reflect the values of each market so your app might better resonate with the local audience.\n\nFor details, see Localize App Store information.\n\nTo learn about localizing your app, seeExpanding Your App to New Markets.\n\nGet more from your product page\nProduct page optimization\n\nTry out alternate versions of your app’s product page with different icons, screenshots, and app previews to find out which one gets the best results. Each version is shown to a percentage of randomly selected, eligible App Store users and results appear in App Analytics, so you can set the best performing one to display to everyone on the App Store.\n\nLearn more\n\nCustom product pages\n\nCreate additional versions of your app’s product page to highlight specific features or content, discoverable through unique URLs that you share. Custom product pages can have different screenshots, app previews, and promotional text — and are fully localizable — so you can showcase a particular sport, character, show, gameplay feature, and more.\n\nLearn more\n\nMetadata for Other Apple Platforms\n\nFind out how to prepare your product page metadata.\n\nApp Store for Apple Watch\nApp Store for Apple TV\nApp Store for iMessage\nApp Store for visionOS"

    "title": "App Review Guidelines - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/",
    "html": "App Review Guidelines\n\nApps are changing the world, enriching people’s lives, and enabling developers like you to innovate like never before. As a result, the App Store has grown into an exciting and vibrant ecosystem for millions of developers and more than a billion users. Whether you are a first-time developer or a large team of experienced programmers, we are excited that you are creating apps for our platforms, and want to help you understand our guidelines so you can be confident your app will get through the review process quickly.\n\nIntroduction\nBefore You Submit\n1. Safety\n2. Performance\n3. Business\n4. Design\n5. Legal\nAfter You Submit\nShow Notarization Review Guidelines Only\nIntroduction\n\nThe guiding principle of the App Store is simple—we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We do this by offering a highly curated App Store where every app is reviewed by experts and an editorial team helps users discover new apps every day. We also scan each app for malware and other software that may impact user safety, security, and privacy. These efforts have made Apple’s platforms the safest for consumers around the world.\n\nIn the European Union, developers can also distribute notarized iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces. Learn more about alternative app marketplaces and Notarization for iOS apps. You can see which guidelines apply to Notarization for iOS apps by clicking on “Show Notarization Review Guidelines Only” in the menu to the left.\n\nFor everything else there is always the open Internet. If the App Store model and guidelines or alternative app marketplaces and Notarization for iOS apps are not best for your app or business idea that’s okay, we provide Safari for a great web experience too.\n\nOn the following pages you will find our latest guidelines arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and Legal. The App Store is always changing and improving to keep up with the needs of our customers and our products. Your apps should change and improve as well in order to stay on the App Store.\n\nA few other points to keep in mind about distributing your app on our platforms:\n\nWe have lots of kids downloading lots of apps. Parental controls work great to protect kids, but you have to do your part too. So know that we’re keeping an eye out for the kids.\nThe App Store is a great way to reach hundreds of millions of people around the world. If you build an app that you just want to show to family and friends, the App Store isn’t the best way to do that. Consider using Xcode to install your app on a device for free or use Ad Hoc distribution available to Apple Developer Program members. If you’re just getting started, learn more about the Apple Developer Program.\nWe strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions and the quality of the app experience is great. We will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, “I’ll know it when I see it”. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.\nIf you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer’s work, manipulate ratings or App Store discovery) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Apple Developer Program.\nYou are responsible for making sure everything in your app complies with these guidelines, including ad networks, analytics services, and third-party SDKs, so review and choose them carefully.\nSome features and technologies that are not generally available to developers may be offered as an entitlement for limited use cases. For example, we offer entitlements for CarPlay Audio, HyperVisor, and Privileged File Operations. Review our documentation on developer.apple.com to learn more about entitlements.\n\nWe hope these guidelines help you sail through the review process, and that approvals and rejections remain consistent across the board. This is a living document; new apps presenting new questions may result in new rules at any time. Perhaps your app will trigger this. We love this stuff too, and honor what you do. We’re really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents and make a living, too.\n\nBefore You Submit\n\nTo help your app approval go as smoothly as possible, review the common missteps listed below that can slow down the review process or trigger a rejection. This doesn’t replace the guidelines or guarantee approval, but making sure you can check every item on the list is a good start. If your app no longer functions as intended or you’re no longer actively supporting it, it will be removed from the App Store. Learn more about App Store Improvements.\n\nMake sure you:\n\nTest your app for crashes and bugs\nEnsure that all app information and metadata is complete and accurate\nUpdate your contact information in case App Review needs to reach you\nProvide App Review with full access to your app. If your app includes account-based features, provide either an active demo account or fully-featured demo mode, plus any other hardware or resources that might be needed to review your app (e.g. login credentials or a sample QR code)\nEnable backend services so that they’re live and accessible during review\nInclude detailed explanations of non-obvious features and in-app purchases in the App Review notes, including supporting documentation where appropriate\nCheck whether your app follows guidance in other documentation, such as:\n\nDevelopment Guidelines\n\nUIKit\nAppKit\nWatchKit\nApp extensions\niOS Data Storage Guidelines\nApple File System\nApp Store Connect Help\nDeveloper Account Help\n\nDesign Guidelines\n\nHuman Interface Guidelines\n\nBrand and Marketing Guidelines\n\nMarketing Resources and Identity Guidelines\nApple Pay Marketing Guidelines\nAdd to Apple Wallet Guidelines\nGuidelines for Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights\n\nGuidelines that include  apply to Notarization for iOS apps in the EU.\n\n1. Safety\n\nWhen people install an app from the App Store, they want to feel confident that it’s safe to do so—that the app doesn’t contain upsetting or offensive content, won’t damage their device, and isn’t likely to cause physical harm from its use. We’ve outlined the major pitfalls below, but if you’re looking to shock and offend people, the App Store isn’t the right place for your app. Some of these rules are also included in Notarization for iOS apps.\n\n1.1 Objectionable Content\n\nApps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy. Examples of such content include:\n\n1.1.1 Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted individual or group. Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.\n1.1.2 Realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence. “Enemies” within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific race, culture, real government, corporation, or any other real entity.\n1.1.3 Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms or ammunition.\n1.1.4 Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined as “explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.” This includes “hookup” apps and other apps that may include pornography or be used to facilitate prostitution, or human trafficking and exploitation.\n1.1.5 Inflammatory religious commentary or inaccurate or misleading quotations of religious texts.\n1.1.6 False information and features, including inaccurate device data or trick/joke functionality, such as fake location trackers. Stating that the app is “for entertainment purposes” won’t overcome this guideline. Apps that enable anonymous or prank phone calls or SMS/MMS messaging will be rejected.\n1.1.7 Harmful concepts which capitalize or seek to profit on recent or current events, such as violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, and epidemics.\n1.2 User-Generated Content\n\nApps with user-generated content present particular challenges, ranging from intellectual property infringement to anonymous bullying. To prevent abuse, apps with user-generated content or social networking services must include:\n\nA method for filtering objectionable material from being posted to the app\nA mechanism to report offensive content and timely responses to concerns\nThe ability to block abusive users from the service\nPublished contact information so users can easily reach you\n\nApps with user-generated content or services that end up being used primarily for pornographic content, Chatroulette-style experiences, objectification of real people (e.g. “hot-or-not” voting), making physical threats, or bullying do not belong on the App Store and may be removed without notice. If your app includes user-generated content from a web-based service, it may display incidental mature “NSFW” content, provided that the content is hidden by default and only displayed when the user turns it on via your website.\n\n1.2.1 Creator Content\nApps which feature content from a specific community of users called “creators” are a great opportunity if properly moderated. These apps present a singular, unified experience for customers to interact with various kinds of creator content. They offer tools and programs to help this community of non-developer creators to author, share, and monetize user-generated experiences. These experiences must not change the core features and functionality of the native app—rather, they add content to those structured experiences. These experiences are not native “apps” coded by developers—they are content within the app itself and are treated as user-generated content by App Review. Such creator content may include video, articles, audio, and even casual games. The App Store supports apps offering such user-generated content so long as they follow all Guidelines, including Guideline 1.2 for moderating user-generated content and Guideline 3.1.1 for payments and in-app purchases. Creator apps should share the age rating of the highest age-rated creator content available in the app, and communicate to users which content requires additional purchases.\n1.3 Kids Category\n\nThe Kids Category is a great way for people to easily find apps that are designed for children. If you want to participate in the Kids Category, you should focus on creating a great experience specifically for younger users. These apps must not include links out of the app, purchasing opportunities, or other distractions to kids unless reserved for a designated area behind a parental gate. Keep in mind that once customers expect your app to follow the Kids Category requirements, it will need to continue to meet these guidelines in subsequent updates, even if you decide to deselect the category. Learn more about parental gates.\n\nYou must comply with applicable privacy laws around the world relating to the collection of data from children online. Be sure to review the Privacy section of these guidelines for more information. In addition, Kids Category apps may not send personally identifiable information or device information to third parties. Apps in the Kids Category should not include third-party analytics or third-party advertising. This provides a safer experience for kids. In limited cases, third-party analytics may be permitted provided that the services do not collect or transmit the IDFA or any identifiable information about children (such as name, date of birth, email address), their location, or their devices. This includes any device, network, or other information that could be used directly or combined with other information to identify users and their devices. Third-party contextual advertising may also be permitted in limited cases provided that the services have publicly documented practices and policies for Kids Category apps that include human review of ad creatives for age appropriateness.\n\n1.4 Physical Harm\n\nIf your app behaves in a way that risks physical harm, we may reject it. For example:\n\n1.4.1 Medical apps that could provide inaccurate data or information, or that could be used for diagnosing or treating patients may be reviewed with greater scrutiny.\nApps must clearly disclose data and methodology to support accuracy claims relating to health measurements, and if the level of accuracy or methodology cannot be validated, we will reject your app. For example, apps that claim to take x-rays, measure blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose levels, or blood oxygen levels using only the sensors on the device are not permitted.\nApps should remind users to check with a doctor in addition to using the app and before making medical decisions.\nIf your medical app has received regulatory clearance, please submit a link to that documentation with your app.\n1.4.2 Drug dosage calculators must come from the drug manufacturer, a hospital, university, health insurance company, pharmacy or other approved entity, or receive approval by the FDA or one of its international counterparts. Given the potential harm to patients, we need to be sure that the app will be supported and updated over the long term.\n1.4.3 Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies and licensed or otherwise legal cannabis dispensaries), or tobacco is not allowed.\n1.4.4 Apps may only display DUI checkpoints that are published by law enforcement agencies, and should never encourage drunk driving or other reckless behavior such as excessive speed.\n1.4.5 Apps should not urge customers to participate in activities (like bets, challenges, etc.) or use their devices in a way that risks physical harm to themselves or others.\n1.5 Developer Information\n\nPeople need to know how to reach you with questions and support issues. Make sure your app and its Support URL include an easy way to contact you; this is particularly important for apps that may be used in the classroom. Failure to include accurate and up-to-date contact information not only frustrates customers, but may violate the law in some countries or regions. Also ensure that Wallet passes include valid contact information from the issuer and are signed with a dedicated certificate assigned to the brand or trademark owner of the pass.\n\n1.6 Data Security\n\nApps should implement appropriate security measures to ensure proper handling of user information collected pursuant to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and these Guidelines (see Guideline 5.1 for more information) and prevent its unauthorized use, disclosure, or access by third parties.\n\n1.7 Reporting Criminal Activity\n\nApps for reporting alleged criminal activity must involve local law enforcement, and can only be offered in countries or regions where such involvement is active.\n\n2. Performance\n2.1 App Completeness\n\nSubmissions to App Review, including apps you make available for pre-order, should be final versions with all necessary metadata and fully functional URLs included; placeholder text, empty websites, and other temporary content should be scrubbed before submission. Make sure your app has been tested on-device for bugs and stability before you submit it, and include demo account info (and turn on your back-end service!) if your app includes a login. If you are unable to provide a demo account due to legal or security obligations, you may include a built-in demo mode in lieu of a demo account with prior approval by Apple. Ensure the demo mode exhibits your app’s full features and functionality. If you offer in-app purchases in your app, make sure they are complete, up-to-date, and visible to the reviewer, or that you explain why not in your review notes. Please don’t treat App Review as a software testing service. We will reject incomplete app bundles and binaries that crash or exhibit obvious technical problems.\n\n2.2 Beta Testing\n\nDemos, betas, and trial versions of your app don’t belong on the App Store – use TestFlight instead. Any app submitted for beta distribution via TestFlight should be intended for public distribution and should comply with the App Review Guidelines. Note, however, that apps using TestFlight cannot be distributed to testers in exchange for compensation of any kind, including as a reward for crowd-sourced funding. Significant updates to your beta build should be submitted to TestFlight App Review before being distributed to your testers. To learn more, visit the TestFlight Beta Testing page.\n\n2.3 Accurate Metadata\n\nCustomers should know what they’re getting when they download or buy your app, so make sure all your app metadata, including privacy information, your app description, screenshots, and previews accurately reflect the app’s core experience and remember to keep them up-to-date with new versions.\n\n2.3.1\n(a) Don’t include any hidden, dormant, or undocumented features in your app; your app’s functionality should be clear to end users and App Review. All new features, functionality, and product changes must be described with specificity in the Notes for Review section of App Store Connect (generic descriptions will be rejected) and accessible for review. Similarly, marketing your app in a misleading way, such as by promoting content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners) or promoting a false price, whether within or outside of the App Store, is grounds for removal of your app from the App Store or a block from installing via alternative distribution and termination of your developer account.\n(b) Egregious or repeated behavior is grounds for removal from the Apple Developer Program. We work hard to make the App Store a trustworthy ecosystem and expect our app developers to follow suit; if you’re dishonest, we don’t want to do business with you.\n2.3.2 If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc. require additional purchases. If you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the in-app purchase Display Name, Screenshot and Description are appropriate for a public audience, that you follow the guidance found in Promoting Your In-App Purchases, and that your app properly handles the SKPaymentTransactionObserver method so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your app launches.\n2.3.3 Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, login page, or splash screen. They may also include text and image overlays (e.g. to demonstrate input mechanisms, such as an animated touch point or Apple Pencil) and show extended functionality on device, such as Touch Bar.\n2.3.4 Previews are a great way for customers to see what your app looks like and what it does. To ensure people understand what they’ll be getting with your app, previews may only use video screen captures of the app itself. Stickers and iMessage extensions may show the user experience in the Messages app. You can add narration and video or textual overlays to help explain anything that isn’t clear from the video alone.\n2.3.5 Select the most appropriate category for your app, and check out the App Store Category Definitions if you need help. If you’re way off base, we may change the category for you.\n2.3.6 Answer the age rating questions in App Store Connect honestly so that your app aligns properly with parental controls. If your app is mis-rated, customers might be surprised by what they get, or it could trigger an inquiry from government regulators. If your app includes media that requires the display of content ratings or warnings (e.g. films, music, games, etc.), you are responsible for complying with local requirements in each territory where your app is available.\n2.3.7 Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, pricing information, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to 30 characters. Metadata such as app names, subtitles, screenshots, and previews should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not specific to the metadata type. App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims. Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time or take other appropriate steps to prevent abuse.\n2.3.8 Metadata should be appropriate for all audiences, so make sure your app and in-app purchase icons, screenshots, and previews adhere to a 4+ age rating even if your app is rated higher. For example, if your app is a game that includes violence, select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. Use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app metadata is reserved in the App Store for the Kids Category. Remember to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, Apple Watch app, alternate icons, etc.), are similar to avoid creating confusion.\n2.3.9 You are responsible for securing the rights to use all materials in your app icons, screenshots, and previews, and you should display fictional account information instead of data from a real person.\n2.3.10 Make sure your app is focused on the iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS experience, and don’t include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms or alternative app marketplaces in your app or metadata, unless there is specific, approved interactive functionality. Make sure your app metadata is focused on the app itself and its experience. Don’t include irrelevant information.\n2.3.11 Apps you submit for pre-order on the App Store must be complete and deliverable as submitted. Ensure that the app you ultimately release is not materially different from what you advertise while the app is in a pre-order state. If you make material changes to the app (e.g. change business models), you should restart your pre-order sales.\n2.3.12 Apps must clearly describe new features and product changes in their “What’s New” text. Simple bug fixes, security updates, and performance improvements may rely on a generic description, but more significant changes must be listed in the notes.\n2.3.13 In-app events are timely events that happen within your app. To feature your event on the App Store, it must fall within an event type provided in App Store Connect. All event metadata must be accurate and pertain to the event itself, rather than the app more generally. Events must happen at the times and dates you select in App Store Connect, including across multiple storefronts. You may monetize your event so long as you follow the rules set forth in Section 3 on Business. And your event deep link must direct users to the proper destination within your app. Read In-App Events for detailed guidance on acceptable event metadata and event deep links.\n2.4 Hardware Compatibility\n2.4.1 To ensure people get the most out of your app, iPhone apps should run on iPad whenever possible. We encourage you to consider building universal apps so customers can use them on all of their devices. Learn more about Universal apps.\n2.4.2 Design your app to use power efficiently and be used in a way that does not risk damage to the device. Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. For example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging or perform excessive write cycles to the solid state drive. Apps, including any third-party advertisements displayed within them, may not run unrelated background processes, such as cryptocurrency mining.\n2.4.3 People should be able to use your Apple TV app without the need for hardware inputs beyond the Siri remote or third-party game controllers, but feel free to provide enhanced functionality when other peripherals are connected. If you require a game controller, make sure you clearly explain that in your metadata so customers know they need additional equipment to play.\n2.4.4 Apps should never suggest or require a restart of the device or modifications to system settings unrelated to the core functionality of the app. For example, don’t encourage users to turn off Wi-Fi, disable security features, etc.\n2.4.5 Apps distributed via the Mac App Store have some additional requirements to keep in mind:\n(i) They must be appropriately sandboxed, and follow macOS File System Documentation. They should also only use the appropriate macOS APIs for modifying user data stored by other apps (e.g. bookmarks, Address Book, or Calendar entries).\n(ii) They must be packaged and submitted using technologies provided in Xcode; no third-party installers allowed. They must also be self-contained, single app installation bundles and cannot install code or resources in shared locations.\n(iii) They may not auto-launch or have other code run automatically at startup or login without consent nor spawn processes that continue to run without consent after a user has quit the app. They should not automatically add their icons to the Dock or leave shortcuts on the user desktop.\n(iv) They may not download or install standalone apps, kexts, additional code, or resources to add functionality or significantly change the app from what we see during the review process.\n(v) They may not request escalation to root privileges or use setuid attributes.\n(vi) They may not present a license screen at launch, require license keys, or implement their own copy protection.\n(vii) They must use the Mac App Store to distribute updates; other update mechanisms are not allowed.\n(viii) Apps should run on the currently shipping OS and may not use deprecated or optionally installed technologies (e.g. Java)\n(ix) Apps must contain all language and localization support in a single app bundle.\n2.5 Software Requirements\n2.5.1 Apps may only use public APIs and must run on the currently shipping OS. Learn more about public APIs. Keep your apps up-to-date and make sure you phase out any deprecated features, frameworks or technologies that will no longer be supported in future versions of an OS. Apps should use APIs and frameworks for their intended purposes and indicate that integration in their app description. For example, the HomeKit framework should provide home automation services; and HealthKit should be used for health and fitness purposes and integrate with the Health app.\n2.5.2 Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code which introduces or changes features or functionality of the app, including other apps. Educational apps designed to teach, develop, or allow students to test executable code may, in limited circumstances, download code provided that such code is not used for other purposes. Such apps must make the source code provided by the app completely viewable and editable by the user.\n2.5.3 Apps that transmit viruses, files, computer code, or programs that may harm or disrupt the normal operation of the operating system and/or hardware features, including Push Notifications and Game Center, will be rejected. Egregious violations and repeat behavior will result in removal from the Apple Developer Program.\n2.5.4 Multitasking apps may only use background services for their intended purposes: VoIP, audio playback, location, task completion, local notifications, etc.\n2.5.5 Apps must be fully functional on IPv6-only networks.\n2.5.6 Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit JavaScript. You may apply for an entitlement to use an alternative web browser engine in your app. Learn more about these entitlements.\n2.5.7 Intentionally omitted.\n2.5.8 Apps that create alternate desktop/home screen environments or simulate multi-app widget experiences will be rejected.\n2.5.9 Apps that alter or disable the functions of standard switches, such as the Volume Up/Down and Ring/Silent switches, or other native user interface elements or behaviors will be rejected. For example, apps should not block links out to other apps or other features that users would expect to work a certain way.\n2.5.10 Apps should not be submitted with empty ad banners or test advertisements.\n2.5.11 SiriKit and Shortcuts\n(i) Apps integrating SiriKit and Shortcuts should only sign up for intents they can handle without the support of an additional app and that users would expect from the stated functionality. For example, if your app is a meal planning app, you should not incorporate an intent to start a workout, even if the app shares integration with a fitness app.\n(ii) Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the Siri functionality of the intents the app has registered for. Aliases must relate directly to your app or company name and should not be generic terms or include third-party app names or services.\n(iii) Resolve the Siri request or Shortcut in the most direct way possible and do not insert ads or other marketing between the request and its fulfillment. Only request a disambiguation when required to complete the task (e.g. asking the user to specify a particular type of workout).\n2.5.12 Apps using CallKit or including an SMS Fraud Extension should only block phone numbers that are confirmed spam. Apps that include call-, SMS-, and MMS- blocking functionality or spam identification must clearly identify these features in their marketing text and explain the criteria for their blocked and spam lists. You may not use the data accessed via these tools for any purpose not directly related to operating or improving your app or extension (e.g. you may not use, share, or sell it for tracking purposes, creating user profiles, etc.).\n2.5.13 Apps using facial recognition for account authentication must use LocalAuthentication (and not ARKit or other facial recognition technology) where possible, and must use an alternate authentication method for users under 13 years old.\n2.5.14 Apps must request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual and/or audible indication when recording, logging, or otherwise making a record of user activity. This includes any use of the device camera, microphone, screen recordings, or other user inputs.\n2.5.15 Apps that enable users to view and select files should include items from the Files app and the user’s iCloud documents.\n2.5.16 Widgets, extensions, and notifications should be related to the content and functionality of your app.\n(a) Additionally, all App Clip features and functionality must be included in the main app binary. App Clips cannot contain advertising.\n2.5.17 Apps that support Matter must use Apple’s support framework for Matter to initiate pairing. In addition, if you choose to use any Matter software component in your app other than the Matter SDK provided by Apple, the software component must be certified by the Connectivity Standards Alliance for the platform it runs on.\n2.5.18 Display advertising should be limited to your main app binary, and should not be included in extensions, App Clips, widgets, notifications, keyboards, watchOS apps, etc. Ads displayed in an app must be appropriate for the app’s age rating, allow the user to see all information used to target them for that ad (without requiring the user to leave the app), and may not engage in targeted or behavioral advertising based on sensitive user data such as health/medical data (e.g. from the HealthKit APIs), school and classroom data (e.g. from ClassKit), or from kids (e.g. from apps in the App Store’s Kids Category), etc. Interstitial ads or ads that interrupt or block the user experience must clearly indicate that they are an ad, must not manipulate or trick users into tapping into them, and must provide easily accessible and visible close/skip buttons large enough for people to easily dismiss the ad. Apps that contain ads must also include the ability for users to report any inappropriate or age-inappropriate ads.\n3. Business\n\nThere are many ways to monetize your app on the App Store. If your business model isn’t obvious, make sure to explain in its metadata and App Review notes. If we can’t understand how your app works or your in-app purchases aren’t immediately obvious, it will delay your review and may trigger a rejection. And while pricing is up to you, we won’t distribute apps and in-app purchase items that are clear rip-offs. We’ll reject expensive apps that try to cheat users with irrationally high prices.\n\nIf we find that you have attempted to manipulate reviews, inflate your chart rankings with paid, incentivized, filtered, or fake feedback, or engage with third-party services to do so on your behalf, we will take steps to preserve the integrity of the App Store, which may include expelling you from the Apple Developer Program.\n\n3.1 Payments\n3.1.1 In-App Purchase:\nIf you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency wallets, etc.\nApps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to “tip” the developer or digital content providers in the app.\nAny credits or in-game currencies purchased via in-app purchase may not expire, and you should make sure you have a restore mechanism for any restorable in-app purchases.\nApps may enable gifting of items that are eligible for in-app purchase to others. Such gifts may only be refunded to the original purchaser and may not be exchanged.\nApps distributed via the Mac App Store may host plug-ins or extensions that are enabled with mechanisms other than the App Store.\nApps offering “loot boxes” or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items for purchase must disclose the odds of receiving each type of item to customers prior to purchase.\nDigital gift cards, certificates, vouchers, and coupons which can be redeemed for digital goods or services can only be sold in your app using in-app purchase. Physical gift cards that are sold within an app and then mailed to customers may use payment methods other than in-app purchase.\nNon-subscription apps may offer a free time-based trial period before presenting a full unlock option by setting up a Non-Consumable IAP item at Price Tier 0 that follows the naming convention: “XX-day Trial.” Prior to the start of the trial, your app must clearly identify its duration, the content or services that will no longer be accessible when the trial ends, and any downstream charges the user would need to pay for full functionality. Learn more about managing content access and the duration of the trial period using Receipts and Device Check.\nApps may use in-app purchase to sell and sell services related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as minting, listing, and transferring. Apps may allow users to view their own NFTs, provided that NFT ownership does not unlock features or functionality within the app. Apps may allow users to browse NFT collections owned by others, provided that the apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\n3.1.1(a) Link to Other Purchase Methods: Developers may apply for entitlements to provide a link in their app to a website the developer owns or maintains responsibility for in order to purchase digital content or services. Please see additional details below.\nStoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlements: apps on the App Store in specific regions may offer in-app purchases and also use a StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement to include a link to the developer’s website that informs users of other ways to purchase digital goods or services. Learn more about these entitlements. In accordance with the entitlement agreements, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the fact that such items may be available for a comparatively lower price. The entitlements are limited to use only in the iOS or iPadOS App Store in specific storefronts. In all other storefronts, apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\nMusic Streaming Services Entitlements: music streaming apps in specific regions can use Music Streaming Services Entitlements to include a link (which may take the form of a buy button) to the developer’s website that informs users of other ways to purchase digital music content or services. These entitlements also permit music streaming app developers to invite users to provide their email address for the express purpose of sending them a link to the developer’s website to purchase digital music content or services. Learn more about these entitlements. In accordance with the entitlement agreements, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the price of such items. The entitlements are limited to use only in the iOS or iPadOS App Store in specific storefronts. In all other storefronts, streaming music apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\nIf your app engages in misleading marketing practices, scams, or fraud in relation to the entitlement, your app will be removed from the App Store and you may be removed from the Apple Developer Program.\n3.1.2 Subscriptions: Apps may offer auto-renewable in-app purchase subscriptions, regardless of category on the App Store. When incorporating auto-renewable subscriptions into your app, be sure to follow the guidelines below.\n3.1.2(a) Permissible uses: If you offer an auto-renewable subscription, you must provide ongoing value to the customer, and the subscription period must last at least seven days and be available across all of the user’s devices. While the following list is not exhaustive, examples of appropriate subscriptions include: new game levels; episodic content; multiplayer support; apps that offer consistent, substantive updates; access to large collections of, or continually updated, media content; software as a service (“SAAS”); and cloud support. In addition:\nSubscriptions may be offered alongside à la carte offerings (e.g. you may offer a subscription to an entire library of films as well the purchase or rental of a single movie).\nYou may offer a single subscription that is shared across your own apps and services.\nGames offered in a streaming game service subscription may offer a single subscription that is shared across third-party apps and services; however, they must be downloaded directly from the App Store, must be designed to avoid duplicate payment by a subscriber, and should not disadvantage non-subscriber customers.\nSubscriptions must work on all of the user’s devices where the app is available. Learn more about sharing a subscription across your apps.\nApps must not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the app.\nAs with all apps, those offering subscriptions should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc.\nSubscriptions may include consumable credits, gems, in-game currencies, etc., and you may offer subscriptions that include access to discounted consumable goods (e.g. a platinum membership that exposes gem-packs for a reduced price).\nIf you are changing your existing app to a subscription-based business model, you should not take away the primary functionality existing users have already paid for. For example, let customers who have already purchased a “full game unlock” continue to access the full game after you introduce a subscription model for new customers.\nAuto-renewable subscription apps may offer a free trial period to customers by providing the relevant information set forth in App Store Connect. Learn more about providing subscription offers.\nApps that attempt to scam users will be removed from the App Store. This includes apps that attempt to trick users into purchasing a subscription under false pretenses or engage in bait-and-switch and scam practices; these will be removed from the App Store and you may be removed from the Apple Developer Program.\nCellular carrier apps may include auto-renewable music and video subscriptions when purchased in bundles with new cellular data plans, with prior approval by Apple. Other auto-renewable subscriptions may also be included in bundles when purchased with new cellular data plans, with prior approval by Apple, if the cellular carrier apps support in-app purchase for users. Such subscriptions cannot include access to or discounts on consumable items, and the subscriptions must terminate coincident with the cellular data plan.\n3.1.2(b) Upgrades and Downgrades: Users should have a seamless upgrade/downgrade experience and should not be able to inadvertently subscribe to multiple variations of the same thing. Review best practices on managing your subscription upgrade and downgrade options.\n3.1.2(c) Subscription Information: Before asking a customer to subscribe, you should clearly describe what the user will get for the price. How many issues per month? How much cloud storage? What kind of access to your service? Ensure you clearly communicate the requirements described in Schedule 2 of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.\n3.1.3 Other Purchase Methods: The following apps may use purchase methods other than in-app purchase. Apps in this section cannot, within the app, encourage users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, except as set forth in 3.1.3(a). Developers can send communications outside of the app to their user base about purchasing methods other than in-app purchase.\n3.1.3(a) “Reader” Apps: Apps may allow a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video). Reader apps may offer account creation for free tiers, and account management functionality for existing customers. Reader app developers may apply for the External Link Account Entitlement to provide an informational link in their app to a web site the developer owns or maintains responsibility for in order to create or manage an account. Learn more about the External Link Account Entitlement.\n3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services: Apps that operate across multiple platforms may allow users to access content, subscriptions, or features they have acquired in your app on other platforms or your web site, including consumable items in multi-platform games, provided those items are also available as in-app purchases within the app.\n3.1.3(c) Enterprise Services: If your app is only sold directly by you to organizations or groups for their employees or students (for example professional databases and classroom management tools), you may allow enterprise users to access previously-purchased content or subscriptions. Consumer, single user, or family sales must use in-app purchase.\n3.1.3(d) Person-to-Person Services: If your app enables the purchase of real-time person-to-person services between two individuals (for example tutoring students, medical consultations, real estate tours, or fitness training), you may use purchase methods other than in-app purchase to collect those payments. One-to-few and one-to-many real-time services must use in-app purchase.\n3.1.3(e) Goods and Services Outside of the App: If your app enables people to purchase physical goods or services that will be consumed outside of the app, you must use purchase methods other than in-app purchase to collect those payments, such as Apple Pay or traditional credit card entry.\n3.1.3(f) Free Stand-alone Apps: Free apps acting as a stand-alone companion to a paid web based tool (e.g. VoIP, Cloud Storage, Email Services, Web Hosting) do not need to use in-app purchase, provided there is no purchasing inside the app, or calls to action for purchase outside of the app.\n3.1.3(g) Advertising Management Apps: Apps for the sole purpose of allowing advertisers (persons or companies that advertise a product, service, or event) to purchase and manage advertising campaigns across media types (television, outdoor, websites, apps, etc.) do not need to use in-app purchase. These apps are intended for campaign management purposes and do not display the advertisements themselves. Digital purchases for content that is experienced or consumed in an app, including buying advertisements to display in the same app (such as sales of “boosts” for posts in a social media app) must use in-app purchase.\n3.1.4 Hardware-Specific Content: In limited circumstances, such as when features are dependent upon specific hardware to function, the app may unlock that functionality without using in-app purchase (e.g. an astronomy app that adds features when synced with a telescope). App features that work in combination with an approved physical product (such as a toy) on an optional basis may unlock functionality without using in-app purchase, provided that an in-app purchase option is available as well. You may not, however, require users to purchase unrelated products or engage in advertising or marketing activities to unlock app functionality.\n3.1.5 Cryptocurrencies:\n(i) Wallets: Apps may facilitate virtual currency storage, provided they are offered by developers enrolled as an organization.\n(ii) Mining: Apps may not mine for cryptocurrencies unless the processing is performed off device (e.g. cloud-based mining).\n(iii) Exchanges: Apps may facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange, provided they are offered only in countries or regions where the app has appropriate licensing and permissions to provide a cryptocurrency exchange.\n(iv) Initial Coin Offerings: Apps facilitating Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”), cryptocurrency futures trading, and other crypto-securities or quasi-securities trading must come from established banks, securities firms, futures commission merchants (“FCM”), or other approved financial institutions and must comply with all applicable law.\n(v) Cryptocurrency apps may not offer currency for completing tasks, such as downloading other apps, encouraging other users to download, posting to social networks, etc.\n3.2 Other Business Model Issues\n\nThe lists below are not exhaustive, and your submission may trigger a change or update to our policies, but here are some additional dos and don’ts to keep in mind:\n\n3.2.1 Acceptable\n(i) Displaying your own apps for purchase or promotion within your app, provided the app is not merely a catalog of your apps.\n(ii) Displaying or recommending a collection of third-party apps that are designed for a specific approved need (e.g. health management, aviation, accessibility). Your app should provide robust editorial content so that it doesn’t seem like a mere storefront.\n(iii) Disabling access to specific approved rental content (e.g. films, television programs, music, books) after the rental period has expired; all other items and services may not expire.\n(iv) Wallet passes can be used to make or receive payments, transmit offers, or offer identification (such as movie tickets, coupons, and VIP credentials). Other uses may result in the rejection of the app and the revocation of Wallet credentials.\n(v) Insurance apps must be free, in legal compliance in the regions distributed, and cannot use in-app purchase.\n(vi) Approved nonprofits may fundraise directly within their own apps or third-party apps, provided those fundraising campaigns adhere to all App Review Guidelines and offer Apple Pay support. These apps must disclose how the funds will be used, abide by all required local and federal laws, and ensure appropriate tax receipts are available to donors. Additional information shall be provided to App Review upon request. Nonprofit platforms that connect donors to other nonprofits must ensure that every nonprofit listed in the app has also gone through the nonprofit approval process. Learn more about becoming an approved nonprofit.\n(vii) Apps may enable individual users to give a monetary gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, provided that (a) the gift is a completely optional choice by the giver, and (b) 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. However, a gift that is connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content or services must use in-app purchase.\n(viii) Apps used for financial trading, investing, or money management should be submitted by the financial institution performing such services.\n3.2.2 Unacceptable\n(i) Creating an interface for displaying third-party apps, extensions, or plug-ins similar to the App Store or as a general-interest collection.\n(ii) Intentionally omitted.\n(iii) Artificially increasing the number of impressions or click-throughs of ads, as well as apps that are designed predominantly for the display of ads.\n(iv) Unless you are an approved nonprofit or otherwise permitted under Section 3.2.1 (vi) above, collecting funds within the app for charities and fundraisers. Apps that seek to raise money for such causes must be free on the App Store and may only collect funds outside of the app, such as via Safari or SMS.\n(v) Arbitrarily restricting who may use the app, such as by location or carrier.\n(vi) Intentionally omitted.\n(vii) Artificially manipulating a user’s visibility, status, or rank on other services unless permitted by that service’s Terms and Conditions.\n(viii) Apps that facilitate binary options trading are not permitted on the App Store. Consider a web app instead. Apps that facilitate trading in contracts for difference (“CFDs”) or other derivatives (e.g. FOREX) must be properly licensed in all jurisdictions where the service is available.\n(ix) Apps offering personal loans must clearly and conspicuously disclose all loan terms, including but not limited to equivalent maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and payment due date. Apps may not charge a maximum APR higher than 36%, including costs and fees, and may not require repayment in full in 60 days or less.\n4. Design\n\nApple customers place a high value on products that are simple, refined, innovative, and easy to use, and that’s what we want to see on the App Store. Coming up with a great design is up to you, but the following are minimum standards for approval to the App Store. And remember that even after your app has been approved, you should update your app to ensure it remains functional and engaging to new and existing customers. Apps that stop working or offer a degraded experience may be removed from the App Store at any time.\n\n4.1 Copycats\n(a) Come up with your own ideas. We know you have them, so make yours come to life. Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own. In addition to risking an intellectual property infringement claim, it makes the App Store harder to navigate and just isn’t fair to your fellow developers.\n(b) Submitting apps which impersonate other apps or services is considered a violation of the Developer Code of Conduct and may result in removal from the Apple Developer Program.\n4.2 Minimum Functionality\n\nYour app should include features, content, and UI that elevate it beyond a repackaged website. If your app is not particularly useful, unique, or “app-like,” it doesn’t belong on the App Store. If your App doesn’t provide some sort of lasting entertainment value or adequate utility, it may not be accepted. Apps that are simply a song or movie should be submitted to the iTunes Store. Apps that are simply a book or game guide should be submitted to the Apple Books Store.\n\n4.2.1 Apps using ARKit should provide rich and integrated augmented reality experiences; merely dropping a model into an AR view or replaying animation is not enough.\n4.2.2 Other than catalogs, apps shouldn’t primarily be marketing materials, advertisements, web clippings, content aggregators, or a collection of links.\n4.2.3\n(i) Your app should work on its own without requiring installation of another app to function.\n(ii) If your app needs to download additional resources in order to function on initial launch, disclose the size of the download and prompt users before doing so.\n4.2.4 Intentionally omitted.\n4.2.5 Intentionally omitted.\n4.2.6 Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be rejected unless they are submitted directly by the provider of the app’s content. These services should not submit apps on behalf of their clients and should offer tools that let their clients create customized, innovative apps that provide unique customer experiences. Another acceptable option for template providers is to create a single binary to host all client content in an aggregated or “picker” model, for example as a restaurant finder app with separate customized entries or pages for each client restaurant, or as an event app with separate entries for each client event.\n4.2.7 Remote Desktop Clients: If your remote desktop app acts as a mirror of specific software or services rather than a generic mirror of the host device, it must comply with the following:\n(a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the user, and both the host device and client must be connected on a local and LAN-based network.\n(b) Any software or services appearing in the client are fully executed on the host device, rendered on the screen of the host device, and may not use APIs or platform features beyond what is required to stream the Remote Desktop.\n(c) All account creation and management must be initiated from the host device.\n(d) The UI appearing on the client does not resemble an iOS or App Store view, does not provide a store-like interface, or include the ability to browse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user. For the sake of clarity, transactions taking place within mirrored software do not need to use in-app purchase, provided the transactions are processed on the host device.\n(e) Thin clients for cloud-based apps are not appropriate for the App Store.\n4.3 Spam\n(a) Don’t create multiple Bundle IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase.\n(b) Also avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated; the App Store has enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, drinking games, and Kama Sutra apps, etc. already. We will reject these apps unless they provide a unique, high-quality experience. Spamming the store may lead to your removal from the Apple Developer Program.\n4.4 Extensions\n\nApps hosting or containing extensions must comply with the App Extension Programming Guide, the Safari app extensions documentation, or the Safari web extensions documentation and should include some functionality, such as help screens and settings interfaces where possible. You should clearly and accurately disclose what extensions are made available in the app’s marketing text, and the extensions may not include marketing, advertising, or in-app purchases.\n\n4.4.1 Keyboard extensions have some additional rules.\n\n\nThey must:\n\nProvide keyboard input functionality (e.g. typed characters);\nFollow Sticker guidelines if the keyboard includes images or emoji;\nProvide a method for progressing to the next keyboard;\nRemain functional without full network access and without requiring full access;\nCollect user activity only to enhance the functionality of the user’s keyboard extension on the iOS device.\n\nThey must not:\n\nLaunch other apps besides Settings; or\nRepurpose keyboard buttons for other behaviors (e.g. holding down the “return” key to launch the camera).\n4.4.2 Safari extensions must run on the current version of Safari on the relevant Apple operating system. They may not interfere with System or Safari UI elements and must never include malicious or misleading content or code. Violating this rule will lead to removal from the Apple Developer Program. Safari extensions should not claim access to more websites than strictly necessary to function.\n4.4.3 Intentionally omitted.\n4.5 Apple Sites and Services\n4.5.1 Apps may use approved Apple RSS feeds such as the iTunes Store RSS feed, but may not scrape any information from Apple sites (e.g. apple.com, the iTunes Store, App Store, App Store Connect, developer portal, etc.) or create rankings using this information.\n4.5.2 Apple Music\n(i) MusicKit on iOS lets users play Apple Music and their local music library natively from your apps and games. When a user provides permission to their Apple Music account, your app can create playlists, add songs to their library, and play any of the millions of songs in the Apple Music catalog. Users must initiate the playback of an Apple Music stream and be able to navigate using standard media controls such as “play,” “pause,” and “skip.” Moreover, your app may not require payment or indirectly monetize access to the Apple Music service (e.g. in-app purchase, advertising, requesting user info, etc.). Do not download, upload, or enable sharing of music files sourced from the MusicKit APIs, except as explicitly permitted in MusicKit documentation.\n(ii) Using the MusicKit APIs is not a replacement for securing the licenses you might need for a deeper or more complex music integration. For example, if you want your app to play a specific song at a particular moment, or to create audio or video files that can be shared to social media, you’ll need to contact rights-holders directly to get their permission (e.g. synchronization or adaptation rights) and assets. Cover art and other metadata may only be used in connection with music playback or playlists (including screenshots displaying your app’s functionality), and should not be used in any marketing or advertising without getting specific authorization from rights-holders. Make sure to follow the Apple Music Identity Guidelines when integrating Apple Music services in your app.\n(iii) Apps that access Apple Music user data, such as playlists and favorites, must clearly disclose this access in the purpose string. Any data collected may not be shared with third parties for any purpose other than supporting or improving the app experience. This data may not be used to identify users or devices, or to target advertising.\n4.5.3 Do not use Apple Services to spam, phish, or send unsolicited messages to customers, including Game Center, Push Notifications, etc. Do not attempt to reverse lookup, trace, relate, associate, mine, harvest, or otherwise exploit Player IDs, aliases, or other information obtained through Game Center, or you will be removed from the Apple Developer Program.\n4.5.4 Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function, and should not be used to send sensitive personal or confidential information. Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your app’s UI, and you provide a method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.\n4.5.5 Only use Game Center Player IDs in a manner approved by the Game Center terms and do not display them in the app or to any third party.\n4.5.6 Apps may use Unicode characters that render as Apple emoji in their app and app metadata. Apple emoji may not be used on other platforms or embedded directly in your app binary.\n4.6 Alternate App Icons\n\nApps may display customized icons, for example, to reflect a sports team preference, provided that each change is initiated by the user and the app includes settings to revert to the original icon. All icon variants must relate to the content of the app and changes should be consistent across all system assets, so that the icons displayed in Settings, Notifications, etc. match the new springboard icon.\n\n4.7 Mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators\n\nApps may offer certain software that is not embedded in the binary, specifically HTML5 mini apps and mini games, streaming games, chatbots, and plug-ins. Additionally, retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games. You are responsible for all such software offered in your app, including ensuring that such software complies with these Guidelines and all applicable laws. Software that does not comply with one or more guidelines will lead to the rejection of your app. You must also ensure that the software adheres to the additional rules that follow in 4.7.1 through 4.7.5. These additional rules are important to preserve the experience that App Store customers expect, and to help ensure user safety.\n\n4.7.1 Software offered in apps under this rule must:\nfollow all privacy guidelines, including but not limited to the rules set forth in Guideline 5.1 concerning collection, use, and sharing of data, and sensitive data (such as health and personal data from kids);\ninclude a method for filtering objectionable material, a mechanism to report content and timely responses to concerns, and the ability to block abusive users; and\nuse in-app purchase in order to offer digital goods or services to end users.\n4.7.2 Your app may not extend or expose native platform APIs to the software without prior permission from Apple.\n4.7.3 Your app may not share data or privacy permissions to any individual software offered in your app without explicit user consent in each instance.\n4.7.4 You must provide an index of software and metadata available in your app. It must include universal links that lead to all of the software offered in your app.\n4.7.5 Your app must share the age rating of the highest age-rated content available in your app.\n4.8 Login Services\n\nApps that use a third-party or social login service (such as Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Sign in with Twitter, Sign In with LinkedIn, Login with Amazon, or WeChat Login) to set up or authenticate the user’s primary account with the app must also offer as an equivalent option another login service with the following features:\n\nthe login service limits data collection to the user’s name and email address;\nthe login service allows users to keep their email address private as part of setting up their account; and\nthe login service does not collect interactions with your app for advertising purposes without consent.\n\nA user’s primary account is the account they establish with your app for the purposes of identifying themselves, signing in, and accessing your features and associated services.\n\nAnother login service is not required if:\n\nYour app exclusively uses your company’s own account setup and sign-in systems.\nYour app is an alternative app marketplace, or an app distributed from an alternative app marketplace, that uses a marketplace-specific login for account, download, and commerce features.\nYour app is an education, enterprise, or business app that requires the user to sign in with an existing education or enterprise account.\nYour app uses a government or industry-backed citizen identification system or electronic ID to authenticate users.\nYour app is a client for a specific third-party service and users are required to sign in to their mail, social media, or other third-party account directly to access their content.\n\n4.9 Apple Pay\n\nApps using Apple Pay must provide all material purchase information to the user prior to sale of any good or service and must use Apple Pay branding and user interface elements correctly, as described in the Apple Pay Marketing Guidelines and Human Interface Guidelines. Apps using Apple Pay to offer recurring payments must, at a minimum, disclose the following information:\n\nThe length of the renewal term and the fact that it will continue until canceled\nWhat will be provided during each period\nThe actual charges that will be billed to the customer\nHow to cancel\n4.10 Monetizing Built-In Capabilities\n\nYou may not monetize built-in capabilities provided by the hardware or operating system, such as Push Notifications, the camera, or the gyroscope; or Apple services and technologies, such as Apple Music access, iCloud storage, or Screen Time APIs.\n\n5. Legal \n\nApps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available (if you’re not sure, check with a lawyer). We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws, not just the guidelines below. And of course, apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected. In extreme cases, such as apps that are found to facilitate human trafficking and/or the exploitation of children, appropriate authorities will be notified.\n\n5.1 Privacy\n\nProtecting user privacy is paramount in the Apple ecosystem, and you should use care when handling personal data to ensure you’ve complied with privacy best practices, applicable laws, and the terms of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, not to mention customer expectations. More particularly:\n\n5.1.1 Data Collection and Storage\n(i) Privacy Policies: All apps must include a link to their privacy policy in the App Store Connect metadata field and within the app in an easily accessible manner. The privacy policy must clearly and explicitly:\nIdentify what data, if any, the app/service collects, how it collects that data, and all uses of that data.\nConfirm that any third party with whom an app shares user data (in compliance with these Guidelines)—such as analytics tools, advertising networks and third-party SDKs, as well as any parent, subsidiary or other related entities that will have access to user data—will provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the app’s privacy policy and required by these Guidelines.\nExplain its data retention/deletion policies and describe how a user can revoke consent and/or request deletion of the user’s data.\n(ii) Permission: Apps that collect user or usage data must secure user consent for the collection, even if such data is considered to be anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection. Paid functionality must not be dependent on or require a user to grant access to this data. Apps must also provide the customer with an easily accessible and understandable way to withdraw consent. Ensure your purpose strings clearly and completely describe your use of the data. Apps that collect data for a legitimate interest without consent by relying on the terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or similar statute must comply with all terms of that law. Learn more about Requesting Permission.\n(iii) Data Minimization: Apps should only request access to data relevant to the core functionality of the app and should only collect and use data that is required to accomplish the relevant task. Where possible, use the out-of-process picker or a share sheet rather than requesting full access to protected resources like Photos or Contacts.\n(iv) Access: Apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access. For example, apps that include the ability to post photos to a social network must not also require microphone access before allowing the user to upload photos. Where possible, provide alternative solutions for users who don’t grant consent. For example, if a user declines to share Location, offer the ability to manually enter an address.\n(v) Account Sign-In: If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a login. If your app supports account creation, you must also offer account deletion within the app. Apps may not require users to enter personal information to function, except when directly relevant to the core functionality of the app or required by law. If your core app functionality is not related to a specific social network (e.g. Facebook, WeChat, Weibo, X, etc.), you must provide access without a login or via another mechanism. Pulling basic profile information, sharing to the social network, or inviting friends to use the app are not considered core app functionality. The app must also include a mechanism to revoke social network credentials and disable data access between the app and social network from within the app. An app may not store credentials or tokens to social networks off of the device and may only use such credentials or tokens to directly connect to the social network from the app itself while the app is in use.\n(vi) Developers that use their apps to surreptitiously discover passwords or other private data will be removed from the Apple Developer Program.\n(vii) SafariViewController must be used to visibly present information to users; the controller may not be hidden or obscured by other views or layers. Additionally, an app may not use SafariViewController to track users without their knowledge and consent.\n(viii) Apps that compile personal information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the App Store or alternative app marketplaces.\n(ix) Apps that provide services in highly regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, legal cannabis use, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.\n(x) Apps may request basic contact information (such as name and email address) so long as the request is optional for the user, features and services are not conditional on providing the information, and it complies with all other provisions of these guidelines, including limitations on collecting information from kids.\n5.1.2 Data Use and Sharing\n(i) Unless otherwise permitted by law, you may not use, transmit, or share someone’s personal data without first obtaining their permission. You must provide access to information about how and where the data will be used. Data collected from apps may only be shared with third parties to improve the app or serve advertising (in compliance with the Apple Developer Program License Agreement). You must receive explicit permission from users via the App Tracking Transparency APIs to track their activity. Learn more about tracking. Your app may not require users to enable system functionalities (e.g. push notifications, location services, tracking) in order to access functionality, content, use the app, or receive monetary or other compensation, including but not limited to gift cards and codes. Apps that share user data without user consent or otherwise complying with data privacy laws may be removed from sale and may result in your removal from the Apple Developer Program.\n(ii) Data collected for one purpose may not be repurposed without further consent unless otherwise explicitly permitted by law.\n(iii) Apps should not attempt to surreptitiously build a user profile based on collected data and may not attempt, facilitate, or encourage others to identify anonymous users or reconstruct user profiles based on data collected from Apple-provided APIs or any data that you say has been collected in an “anonymized,” “aggregated,” or otherwise non-identifiable way.\n(iv) Do not use information from Contacts, Photos, or other APIs that access user data to build a contact database for your own use or for sale/distribution to third parties, and don’t collect information about which other apps are installed on a user’s device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing.\n(v) Do not contact people using information collected via a user’s Contacts or Photos, except at the explicit initiative of that user on an individualized basis; do not include a Select All option or default the selection of all contacts. You must provide the user with a clear description of how the message will appear to the recipient before sending it (e.g. What will the message say? Who will appear to be the sender?).\n(vi) Data gathered from the HomeKit API, HealthKit, Clinical Health Records API, MovementDisorder APIs, ClassKit or from depth and/or facial mapping tools (e.g. ARKit, Camera APIs, or Photo APIs) may not be used for marketing, advertising or use-based data mining, including by third parties. Learn more about best practices for implementing CallKit, HealthKit, ClassKit, and ARKit.\n(vii) Apps using Apple Pay may only share user data acquired via Apple Pay with third parties to facilitate or improve delivery of goods and services.\n5.1.3 Health and Health Research\n\nHealth, fitness, and medical data are especially sensitive and apps in this space have some additional rules to make sure customer privacy is protected:\n\n(i) Apps may not use or disclose to third parties data gathered in the health, fitness, and medical research context—including from the Clinical Health Records API, HealthKit API, Motion and Fitness, MovementDisorder APIs, or health-related human subject research—for advertising, marketing, or other use-based data mining purposes other than improving health management, or for the purpose of health research, and then only with permission. Apps may, however, use a user’s health or fitness data to provide a benefit directly to that user (such as a reduced insurance premium), provided that the app is submitted by the entity providing the benefit, and the data is not shared with a third party. You must disclose the specific health data that you are collecting from the device.\n(ii) Apps must not write false or inaccurate data into HealthKit or any other medical research or health management apps, and may not store personal health information in iCloud.\n(iii) Apps conducting health-related human subject research must obtain consent from participants or, in the case of minors, their parent or guardian. Such consent must include the (a) nature, purpose, and duration of the research; (b) procedures, risks, and benefits to the participant; (c) information about confidentiality and handling of data (including any sharing with third parties); (d) a point of contact for participant questions; and (e) the withdrawal process.\n(iv) Apps conducting health-related human subject research must secure approval from an independent ethics review board. Proof of such approval must be provided upon request.\n5.1.4 Kids\n\n(a) For many reasons, it is critical to use care when dealing with personal data from kids, and we encourage you to carefully review all the requirements for complying with laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and any other applicable regulations or laws.\n\nApps may ask for birthdate and parental contact information only for the purpose of complying with these statutes, but must include some useful functionality or entertainment value regardless of a person’s age.\n\nApps intended primarily for kids should not include third-party analytics or third-party advertising. This provides a safer experience for kids.\n\n(b) In limited cases, third-party analytics and third-party advertising may be permitted provided that the services adhere to the same terms set forth in Guideline 1.3.\n\nMoreover, apps in the Kids Category or those that collect, transmit, or have the capability to share personal information (e.g. name, address, email, location, photos, videos, drawings, the ability to chat, other personal data, or persistent identifiers used in combination with any of the above) from a minor must include a privacy policy and must comply with all applicable children’s privacy statutes. For the sake of clarity, the parental gate requirement for the Kid’s Category is generally not the same as securing parental consent to collect personal data under these privacy statutes.\n\nAs a reminder, Guideline 2.3.8 requires that use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app metadata is reserved for the Kids Category. Apps not in the Kids Category cannot include any terms in app name, subtitle, icon, screenshots or description that imply the main audience for the app is children.\n\n5.1.5 Location Services\n\nUse Location Services in your app only when it is directly relevant to the features and services provided by the app. Location-based APIs shouldn’t be used to provide emergency services or autonomous control over vehicles, aircraft, and other devices, except for small devices such as lightweight drones and toys, or remote control car alarm systems, etc. Ensure that you notify and obtain consent before collecting, transmitting, or using location data. If your app uses Location Services, be sure to explain the purpose in your app; refer to the Human Interface Guidelines for best practices for doing so.\n\n5.2 Intellectual Property\n\nMake sure your app only includes content that you created or that you have a license to use. Your app may be removed if you’ve stepped over the line and used content without permission. Of course, this also means someone else’s app may be removed if they’ve “borrowed” from your work. If you believe your intellectual property has been infringed by another developer on the App Store, submit a claim via our web form. Laws differ in different countries and regions, but at the very least, make sure to avoid the following common errors:\n\n5.2.1 Generally: Don’t use protected third-party material such as trademarks, copyrighted works, or patented ideas in your app without permission, and don’t include misleading, false, or copycat representations, names, or metadata in your app bundle or developer name. Apps should be submitted by the person or legal entity that owns or has licensed the intellectual property and other relevant rights.\n5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services: If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use. Authorization must be provided upon request.\n5.2.3 Audio/Video Downloading: Apps should not facilitate illegal file sharing or include the ability to save, convert, or download media from third-party sources (e.g. Apple Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, etc.) without explicit authorization from those sources. Streaming of audio/video content may also violate Terms of Use, so be sure to check before your app accesses those services. Authorization must be provided upon request.\n5.2.4 Apple Endorsements\n(a) Don’t suggest or imply that Apple is a source or supplier of the App, or that Apple endorses any particular representation regarding quality or functionality.\n(b) If your app is selected as an “Editor’s Choice,” Apple will apply the badge automatically.\n5.2.5 Apple Products Don’t create an app that appears confusingly similar to an existing Apple product, interface (e.g. Finder), app (such as the App Store, iTunes Store, or Messages) or advertising theme. Apps and extensions, including third-party keyboards and Sticker packs, may not include Apple emoji. Music from iTunes and Apple Music previews may not be used for their entertainment value (e.g. as the background music to a photo collage or the soundtrack to a game) or in any other unauthorized manner. If you provide music previews from iTunes or Apple Music, you must display a link to the corresponding music in iTunes or Apple Music. If your app displays Activity rings, they should not visualize Move, Exercise, or Stand data in a way that resembles the Activity control. The Human Interface Guidelines have more information on how to use Activity rings. If your app displays Apple Weather data, it should follow the attribution requirements provided in the WeatherKit documentation.\n5.3 Gaming, Gambling, and Lotteries\n\nGaming, gambling, and lotteries can be tricky to manage and tend to be one of the most regulated offerings on the App Store. Only include this functionality if you’ve fully vetted your legal obligations everywhere you make your app available and are prepared for extra time during the review process. Some things to keep in mind:\n\n5.3.1 Sweepstakes and contests must be sponsored by the developer of the app.\n5.3.2 Official rules for sweepstakes, contests, and raffles must be presented in the app and make clear that Apple is not a sponsor or involved in the activity in any manner.\n5.3.3 Apps may not use in-app purchase to purchase credit or currency for use in conjunction with real money gaming of any kind.\n5.3.4 Apps that offer real money gaming (e.g. sports betting, poker, casino games, horse racing) or lotteries must have necessary licensing and permissions in the locations where the app is used, must be geo-restricted to those locations, and must be free on the App Store. Illegal gambling aids, including card counters, are not permitted on the App Store. Lottery apps must have consideration, chance, and a prize.\n5.4 VPN Apps\n\nApps offering VPN services must utilize the NEVPNManager API and may only be offered by developers enrolled as an organization. You must make a clear declaration of what user data will be collected and how it will be used on an app screen prior to any user action to purchase or otherwise use the service. Apps offering VPN services may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy. VPN apps must not violate local laws, and if you choose to make your VPN app available in a territory that requires a VPN license, you must provide your license information in the App Review Notes field. Parental control, content blocking, and security apps, among others, from approved providers may also use the NEVPNManager API. Apps that do not comply with this guideline will be removed from the App Store and blocked from installing via alternative distribution and you may be removed from the Apple Developer Program.\n\n5.5 Mobile Device Management\n\nMobile Device Management Apps that offer Mobile Device Management (MDM) services must request this capability from Apple. Such apps may only be offered by commercial enterprises, educational institutions, or government agencies, and in limited cases, companies using MDM for parental control services or device security. You must make a clear declaration of what user data will be collected and how it will be used on an app screen prior to any user action to purchase or otherwise use the service. MDM apps must not violate any applicable laws. Apps offering MDM services may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy. In limited cases, third-party analytics may be permitted provided that the services only collect or transmit data about the performance of the developer’s MDM app, and not any data about the user, the user’s device, or other apps used on that device. Apps offering configuration profiles must also adhere to these requirements. Apps that do not comply with this guideline will be removed from the App Store and blocked from installing via alternative distribution and you may be removed from the Apple Developer Program.\n\n5.6 Developer Code of Conduct\n\nPlease treat everyone with respect, whether in your responses to App Store reviews, customer support requests, or when communicating with Apple, including your responses in App Store Connect. Do not engage in harassment of any kind, discriminatory practices, intimidation, bullying, and don’t encourage others to engage in any of the above. Repeated manipulative or misleading behavior or other fraudulent conduct will lead to your removal from the Apple Developer Program.\n\nCustomer trust is a cornerstone of the App ecosystem. Apps should never prey on users or attempt to rip off customers, trick them into making unwanted purchases, force them to share unnecessary data, raise prices in a tricky manner, charge for features or content that are not delivered, or engage in any other manipulative practices within or outside of the app.\n\nYour Developer Program account will be terminated if you engage in activities or actions that are not in accordance with the Developer Code of Conduct. To restore your account, you may provide a written statement detailing the improvements you plan to make. If your plan is approved by Apple and we confirm the changes have been made, your account may be restored.\n\n5.6.1 App Store Reviews\n\nApp Store customer reviews can be an integral part of the app experience, so you should treat customers with respect when responding to their comments. Keep your responses targeted to the user’s comments and do not include personal information, spam, or marketing in your response.\n\nUse the provided API to prompt users to review your app; this functionality allows customers to provide an App Store rating and review without the inconvenience of leaving your app, and we will disallow custom review prompts.\n\n5.6.2 Developer Identity\n\nProviding verifiable information to Apple and customers is critical to customer trust. Your representation of yourself, your business, and your offerings on the App Store or alternative app marketplaces must be accurate. The information you provide must be truthful, relevant, and up-to-date so that Apple and customers understand who they are engaging with and can contact you regarding any issues.\n\n5.6.3 Discovery Fraud\n\nParticipating in the App Store requires integrity and a commitment to building and maintaining customer trust. Manipulating any element of the App Store customer experience such as charts, search, reviews, or referrals to your app erodes customer trust and is not permitted.\n\n5.6.4 App Quality\n\nCustomers expect the highest quality from the App Store, and maintaining high quality content, services, and experiences promotes customer trust. Indications that this expectation is not being met include excessive customer reports about concerns with your app, such as negative customer reviews, and excessive refund requests. Inability to maintain high quality may be a factor in deciding whether a developer is abiding by the Developer Code of Conduct.\n\nAfter You Submit\n\nOnce you’ve submitted your app and metadata in App Store Connect and you’re in the review process, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\nTiming: App Review will examine your app as soon as we can. However, if your app is complex or presents new issues, it may require greater scrutiny and consideration. And remember that if your app is repeatedly rejected for the same guideline violation or you’ve attempted to manipulate the review process, review of your app will take longer to complete. Learn more about App Review.\nStatus Updates: The current status of your app will be reflected in App Store Connect, so you can keep an eye on things from there.\nExpedite Requests: If you have a critical timing issue, you can request an expedited review. Please respect your fellow developers by seeking expedited review only when you truly need it. If we find you’re abusing this system, we may reject your requests going forward.\nRelease Date: If your release date is set for the future, the app will not appear on the App Store until that date, even if it is approved by App Review. And remember that it can take up to 24-hours for your app to appear on all selected storefronts.\nRejections: Our goal is to apply these guidelines fairly and consistently, but nobody’s perfect. If your app has been rejected and you have questions or would like to provide additional information, please use App Store Connect to communicate directly with the App Review team. This may help get your app on the store, and it can help us improve the App Review process or identify a need for clarity in our policies.\nAppeals: If you disagree with the outcome of your review, please submit an appeal. This may help get your app on the store. You may also suggest changes to the guidelines themselves to help us improve the App Review process or identify a need for clarity in our policies.\nBug Fix Submissions: For apps that are already on the App Store or an alternative app marketplace, bug fixes will not be delayed over guideline violations except for those related to legal or safety issues. If your app has been rejected, and qualifies for this process, please use App Store Connect to communicate directly with the App Review team indicating that you would like to take advantage of this process and plan to address the issue in your next submission.\n\nWe’re excited to see what you come up with next!\n\nLast Updated: April 5, 2024"

    "title": "Ad Attribution - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ad-attribution/",
    "html": "Measuring ad performance with AdAttributionKit\n\nAdAttributionKit lets advertisers measure the success of their advertising across multiple channels — all in a way that preserves user privacy. AdAttributionKit features enhanced attribution information and supports measurements for app-to-app-based campaigns, so advertisers can better optimize their efforts across more channels.\n\nApp AdAttributionKit\n\nApp AdAttributionKit lets registered advertising networks and developers attribute app installations to a particular campaign by receiving a signed signal from Apple. App AdAttributionKit supports multiple advertising formats, including static images, videos, audio, and interactive ads. This enables advertisers to verify how many installations came from an ad and measure which campaigns were most effective, without tracking individual users or devices across apps owned by other companies. App AdAttributionKit accomplishes this by limiting the data included in the attribution postback and builds on the functionality of SKAdNetwork.\n\nApp AdAttributionKit attributes installations based on clicks or views (on iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4, or later). Click-through attribution occurs when someone clicks or taps an ad that goes to an app’s product page, and installs the app within 30 days. View-through attribution occurs when someone views an ad and installs the advertised app (without a link in the ad) within 24 hours of viewing the ad.\n\nWhen an app installation occurs, advertisers and developers (if they’re opted in) can receive a postback within 24-48 hours of a user launching the app. Up to three postbacks will be sent to the developer and the winning ad network in the 35 days following an app download for the advertised app. A postback is sent to up to five ad networks, so they can understand when an ad they presented qualified for attribution but didn’t win. A winning postback includes attribution information, including:\n\nAdvertised item ID. The advertised app’s identifier. Called app ID in SKAdNetwork.\nConversion type. Identifies whether the installation was a redownload. Advertisers can use this to evaluate the success of reengagement campaigns. Called redownload information in SKAdNetwork.\nPublisher item ID. The specific app where the advertisement was shown and from which an app installation occurred. This allows advertisers to identify which app should be credited with initiating the download. This value is conditional and only displays when privacy thresholds are met. Called source app ID in SKAdNetwork.\nSource identifier. The source identifier the ad network provided when displaying the ad. Source identifiers contain information about the ad campaign.\nConversion values. Advertisers can configure conversion values based on their preferences, with each representing a different type of engagement. For example, they might configure three conversion values to capture when someone finished an onboarding tutorial, made an in-app purchase, or purchased a subscription. This information can be used alongside the publisher item ID and source identifier (when applicable) to understand the quality of the campaign. This value is conditional and only displays when privacy thresholds are met.\nComing soon in AdAttributionKit\n\nIn addition to measuring how advertising drives downloads of your app, Re-engagement for App AdAttributionKit measures when users reengage with your app after they’ve downloaded it. As a result, you and the ad network receive up to three postbacks when a user opens your app by tapping an advertisement.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nHow does Apple’s crowd anonymity function work?\n\nAd networks and developers will receive additional data in the attribution postback as more installations are attributed to an advertisement. Apple performs a real-time check for a particular download to determine the postback data tier and the level of information that will be included in the postback.\n\nLearn about receiving postbacks in multiple conversion windows\n\nDo I need to ask for the user’s permission to track them in order to use AdAttributionKit?\n\nNo. AdAttributionKit allows advertising networks to attribute app installations while preserving user privacy, so you don’t need to use the AppTrackingTransparency prompt. However, if your app includes any instances of tracking, you’ll need to receive the user’s permission through the AppTrackingTransparency framework to track them or access their device’s advertising identifier.\n\nLearn more about user privacy and data use\n\nWhat kind of conversion events does App AdAttributionKit support?\n\nUp to 64 signals of user value can be shared with your advertising network on an AdAttributionKit install notification.\n\nLearn about understanding AdAttributionKit and SKAdNetwork interoperability\n\nWhat if the value for conversion-value or publisher item ID is null in a postback?\n\nIn order to maintain user privacy, conversion-value and source-app-id are conditional values that are only included in App AdAttributionKit postbacks when certain thresholds are met. In the absence of a conditional value, your network (or any advertising partner’s networks you work with) might represent the value as “null.”\n\nCan I use multiple advertising networks for the purposes of App AdAttributionKit?\n\nYes. You can use multiple advertising networks as long as they are registered with AdAttributionKit. Contact your advertising networks of choice to understand whether they are integrated with AdAttributionKit.\n\nHow does App AdAttributionKit attribute app installs?\n\nAn app installation is attributed when a user launches the advertised app. If more than one advertisement was displayed to a user, the attribution goes to the ad most recently tapped by the user. If no ads were tapped, attribution goes to the ad most recently displayed to the user.\n\nabout verifying an installation-validation post back\n\nWhat does App AdAttributionKit do to minimize advertising fraud?\n\nAll transactions that are tied to an AdAttributionKit event are cryptographically signed and verified by Apple in order to prove the postback is attached to a known conversion event by Apple. The postback also includes a unique transaction ID (a unique identifier for a transaction such as a purchase or redownload) in order to detect replays of valid conversion events.\n\nCan I use App AdAttributionKit in conjunction with fingerprinting?\n\nNo. You may not derive data from a device for the purpose of uniquely identifying it, per the Apple Developer Program License Agreement. Examples of user or device data include, but are not limited to: properties of a user’s web browser and its configuration, the user’s device and its configuration, the user’s location, or the user’s network connection.

    "html": "App Store Small Business Program\n\nPropel your small business forward with the next generation of groundbreaking apps on the App Store and invest more resources into your business.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe App Store Small Business Program is designed to accelerate innovation and help propel your small business forward with the next generation of groundbreaking apps on the App Store. It features a reduced commission rate of 15% on paid apps and in-app purchases, so you can invest more resources into your business to continue building quality apps that customers love.\n\nThe basics\nExisting developers who made up to 1 million USD in proceeds in the prior calendar year for all their apps, as well as developers new to the App Store, can qualify for the program and the reduced commission.\nIf a participating developer surpasses the 1 million USD threshold in the current calendar year, the standard commission rate will apply to future sales.\nIf a developer’s proceeds fall below the 1 million USD threshold in a future calendar year, they can re-qualify for the 15% commission the year after.\nDevelopers must identify any Associated Developer Accounts to determine proceeds eligibility.\nAssociated Developer Accounts\n\nTo ensure that all participants are fully eligible as small businesses, you’ll need to list all of your Associated Developer Accounts when you sign up for this program. An Associated Developer Account is an Apple Developer Program account that you own or control or an Apple Developer Program account that owns or controls your account. For additional information, see the FAQs below.\n\nProceeds eligibility\n\nTo participate in the program, you and your Associated Developer Accounts must have earned no more than 1 million USD in total proceeds (sales net of Apple’s commission and certain taxes and adjustments) during the 12 fiscal months occurring within the previous calendar year, and have earned no more than 1 million USD during the current year. When an app is transferred, proceeds for the calendar year will be associated with all accounts that initiate or accept the transfer of that app. For additional information, see the FAQs below.\n\nEnrolling is simple\n\nThe vast majority of developers on the App Store who sell digital goods and services are eligible — simply complete a few steps to enroll.\n\nTo enroll, you’ll need to:\n\nBe an Account Holder in the Apple Developer Program,\nReview and accept the latest Paid Apps agreement (Schedule 2 to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement) in App Store Connect, and\nIf applicable, list all of your Associated Developer Accounts.\nGet started today.\n\nEnroll now\n\nFrequently asked questions\nWhen will my adjusted proceeds go into effect?\n\nYour proceeds will be adjusted fifteen (15) days after the end of the fiscal calendar month in which your enrollment is approved. For example, if your enrollment is approved on February 10, 2022, your proceeds are adjusted starting March 14, 2022.\n\nHow do I estimate whether I’m eligible for the program based on my proceeds?\n\nYour eligibility is based on your total App Store proceeds converted into United States dollars (USD) in the prior calendar year. Proceeds are your sales net of Apple’s commission and certain taxes and adjustments. To estimate your proceeds, use the payments deposited into your bank account and your tax and adjustment details in App Store Connect.\n\nIf your bank account currency is in USD. Add the total App Store payments deposited into your bank account in the prior calendar year. Then modify that amount with any taxes and adjustments from the Payments and Financial Reports section of App Store Connect. For taxes and adjustments in other currencies, use the USD exchange rate shown in App Store Connect for each month.\nIf your bank account currency is not in USD. You’ll need to convert your App Store payments deposited into your bank account in the prior calendar year into USD. Use a publicly available exchange rate that corresponds with the end of each fiscal month in Apple’s fiscal calendar to calculate your total USD proceeds. Then modify the total USD amount with any taxes and adjustments from the Payments and Financial Reports section of App Store Connect.\n\nMake sure to add the proceeds for any Associated Developer Accounts.\n\nWhy do I need to list my Associated Developer Accounts?\n\nThe App Store Small Business Program is intended for small businesses and individual developers. If your organization controls other Apple Developer Program accounts or is controlled by another account that sells digital goods and services on the App Store, the collective proceeds from these related organizations must not exceed the 1 million USD threshold in order to qualify for the program.\n\nHow do I know if I have an Associated Developer Account?\n\nAs the individual or legal entity who accepted the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, you have an Associated Developer Account if any of the following apply:\n\nYou have majority (over 50%) corporate, individual, or partnership interest in the ownership or shares of another Apple Developer Program account.\nAnother Apple Developer Program member has majority (over 50%) corporate, individual, or partnership interest in the ownership or shares of your account.\nYou have ultimate decision-making authority over another Apple Developer Program account.\nAnother Apple Developer Program member has ultimate decision-making authority over your account.\nWhat details about my Associated Developer Account will I need to provide?\n\nIn addition to stating how many Associated Developer Accounts you have, you must provide the following details for each account:\n\nName (individual or organization)\nTeam ID\nAccount Holder email address\nDescription of relationship between you and the account\nHow do app transfers impact my participation in the program?\n\nApp transfers are allowed. However, when an app is transferred, the proceeds for the calendar year will be associated with all accounts that initiate or accept the transfer of that app. Program eligibility is based on total proceeds from all Associated Developer Accounts and transferred apps.\n\nIf I have additional questions who should I contact?\n\nApple Developer Support can help.

    "html": "Customers can now resolve payment issues without leaving your app. Learn more\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions\n\nOffer a seamless experience for digital subscriptions in your apps. StoreKit APIs provide a simple, powerful way to implement auto-renewable subscriptions in apps on all Apple platforms and in all App Store categories.\n\nOverview\nCreating subscriptions\nAttracting Subscribers\nProviding subscription offers\nKeeping subscribers\nOverview\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions provide access to content, services, or premium features in your app on an ongoing basis. They automatically renew at the end of their duration until the user chooses to cancel. Subscriptions are available on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.\n\nGreat subscription apps justify the recurring payment by providing ongoing value and continually innovating the app experience. If you’re considering implementing the subscription model, plan to regularly update your app with feature enhancements or expanded content.\n\nMany types of apps can take advantage of subscriptions, including apps that offer new game levels, episodic content, software as a service, or cloud support. Other appropriate subscriptions include apps that offer consistent, substantive updates, or access to libraries or collections of content. You can offer subscriptions (a type of in-app purchase) alongside other in-app purchase types.\n\nGetting ready\n\nTo offer subscriptions, youʼll need to configure them in App Store Connect and use StoreKit APIs in your app. You’ll also need to assign each subscription to a subscription group (a group of subscriptions with different access levels, prices, and durations that people can choose from), then add details such as a name, price, and description. This information displays in the In-App Purchases section of your app’s product page on the App Store. Ensure that the subscriptions are available across all device types that your app supports. Consider allowing a way for subscribers to see the status of their subscription within your app, along with upgrade, crossgrade, and downgrade options, as well as a way to easily manage or turn off their auto-renewable subscription. Make sure to follow our design and review guidelines.\n\nTo get ready:\n\nWatch the In-App Purchase and Subscriptions videos.\nRefer to the In-App Purchase StoreKit API documentation.\nLearn how to configure your subscriptions in App Store Connect Help.\nUse the App Store Server API and enable App Store Server Notifications to get real-time changes to the status of your subscriptions.\nUnderstanding subscription guidelines\n\nBefore creating your subscriptions, make sure you understand the requirements and best practices that will help you deliver a great experience. The guidelines below provide details on what your subscriptions need to include and how they should be presented in your app, as well as information on making changes to existing subscriptions, offering free trials, and more.\n\nResources:\n\nApp Review Guidelines\nHuman Interface Design Guidelines\n85% net revenue after one year\n\nThe net revenue structure for auto-renewable subscriptions differs from other business models on the App Store. During a subscriber’s first year of service, you receive 70% of the subscription price at each billing cycle, minus applicable taxes. After a subscriber accumulates one year of paid service, your net revenue increases to 85% of the subscription price, minus applicable taxes.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions on all Apple platforms are eligible.\nDays of paid service include all subscription offer types (introductory, promotional, and offer codes) with paid pricing options (pay as you go, pay up front).\nFree trials and renewal extensions are excluded from days of paid service.\nDays of paid service are specific to each subscription group.\nUpgrades, downgrades, or crossgrades between subscriptions in the same subscription group don’t affect the one year of paid service.\nIf you’re currently enrolled in the App Store Small Business Program, you receive 85% of the subscription price at each billing cycle (minus applicable taxes), regardless of whether or not the subscription has accumulated one year of paid service.\n\nIf a subscription expires due to a cancellation or billing issue, the days of paid service stop accumulating. If the subscription is renewed within 60 days, the days of paid service resume from the recovery date.\n\nCreating subscriptions\n\nYou’ll configure your auto-renewable subscriptions in App Store Connect. Create each subscription product as part of a subscription group and assign it a level. How you set up your subscription group or groups will determine your proceeds rate, as well as how people can subscribe to your content or services, how they move between subscriptions, and when they are billed. Before creating subscriptions, identify the right subscription setup for your business model.\n\nCreating a subscription group\n\nEach subscription you offer must be assigned to a subscription group. A subscription group is made up of subscriptions with different access levels, prices, and durations so people can select the option that best fits their needs. Since people can only buy one subscription within a group at a time, creating a single group is the best practice for most apps as it prevents people from accidentally purchasing multiple subscriptions.\n\nIf your app needs to offer the ability to buy multiple subscriptions — for example, to subscribe to more than one channel in a streaming app — you can add these subscriptions to different groups. People who buy subscriptions in multiple groups are billed separately for each subscription. Keep in mind that if a someone cancels a subscription in one group and then purchases a new subscription in a different group, the renewal date will change and the days of paid service will reset.\n\nMultiple subscription groups aren’t recommended for apps in which people would expect to have a single active subscription. Keep your offerings simple and easy to understand. For each subscription, create a user-friendly, self-explanatory name that differentiates it from others in the group. Use distinct names for the app, the subscription group, and each subscription to avoid confusion.\n\nApp Name or Custom App Name\nSubscription Display Name\nPrice/Duration\nRanking subscriptions within the group\n\nIf you offer multiple subscriptions with different prices tiers, you can assign each to a level in App Store Connect. Ranking your subscriptions determines the upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade paths available. Arrange your subscriptions in order from the one that offers the most (level 1) to the one that offers the least. For subscriptions with lower service or content offerings, you might assign level 2 or 3, depending on your intended subscription experience. You can add more than one subscription to each level if the offerings are equal. For details, see Overview of an Auto-renewable Subscription Group Setup.\n\nPeople can manage their subscriptions in their account settings on the App Store, where they see all renewal options and subscription groups, and can choose to upgrade, crossgrade, or downgrade between subscriptions as often as they like. You can also use the showManageSubscriptions(in:) method to allow them to do this within your app. When someone makes a change in their subscription level, the timing of the change varies depending on what has happened:\n\nUpgrade. Someone purchases a subscription that offers a higher level of service than their current subscription. They’re immediately upgraded and receive a refund of the prorated amount of their original subscription. If you’d like people to immediately access more content or features, rank the subscription higher to make it an upgrade.\n\nDowngrade. Someone selects a subscription that offers a lower level of service than their current subscription. The subscription continues until the next renewal date, then is renewed at the lower level and price.\n\nCrossgrade. Someone switches to a new subscription of the equivalent level. If the subscriptions are the same duration, the new subscription begins immediately. If the durations are different, the new subscription goes into effect at the next renewal date.\n\nPricing subscriptions for each territory\n\nApps with auto-renewable subscriptions can choose from 800 price points across all available currencies and price tiers, with an additional 100 higher price points available upon request. You can set the prices you think are appropriate for subscribers in different locations, and you have the flexibility to price your subscriptions at parity across storefronts.\n\nPricing tool. The App Store Connect pricing tool can help you manage pricing based on current exchange rates. If there’s a tax change or currency adjustment in a particular region, the price of subscriptions won’t generally be affected unless you decide to pass the change on to your users. If you want to change the price of a subscription in a specific market, it’s important to understand which markets are tax inclusive before you take action. For example, if you decide to lower the subscription price for users in Germany, the revenue you’ll receive will be the purchase price minus the European Union’s value added tax (VAT) and minus Apple’s commission. The default pricing in the App Store Connect pricing tool is inclusive of applicable taxes that Apple collects and remits. For more information, review Schedule 2 of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, which describes territories that have different tax treatments.\n\nApp Store Connect also lets you assign tax categories to your apps and in-app purchases. These categories are based on your app’s content (for example, videos, books, or news publications) and determine which tax regulations apply in each territory, allowing Apple to administer tax for you at specific rates.\n\nFamily Sharing\n\nFamily Sharing allows a subscriber to share access to an auto-renewable subscription with up to five family members across their Apple devices. With a streamlined, convenient user experience, Family Sharing can help you attract subscribers, encourage paid subscriptions, increase engagement, and improve retention. You can enable Family Sharing for your subscription in App Store Connect. Please note that this can’t be undone.\n\nVerify subscription access using purchase validation, then provide the proper access to subscribers and their family members. Whether a subscription is shared with a subscriber’s family by default depends on their subscription sharing settings and if the purchase was made before or after you enabled Family Sharing in App Store Connect. Subscribers whose settings don’t share the subscription by default are informed by Apple via push notification that the subscription can be shared with their family.\n\nYou can highlight Family Sharing in several ways:\n\nHighlight Family Sharing to potential subscribers. Include Family Sharing in your subscription’s display name so it’s easy to spot when reviewing subscription options. If you offer a Family Sharing-enabled subscription alongside subscriptions that don’t include Family Sharing, you can note the price difference for the Family Sharing option on the sign up screen.\n\nRemind subscribers to enable Family Sharing. Mention Family Sharing within your app — for example, as part of onboarding for new subscribers or via in-app messaging for existing subscribers. Consider explaining how to confirm they’ve turned on Family Sharing for the subscription. If you offer a Family Sharing-enabled subscription they’re not currently subscribed to, you might provide a way for them to upgrade without leaving your app. Make sure you’ve ranked your subscriptions within the same subscription level in App Store Connect to provide a seamless upgrade experience.\n\nHelp subscribers share subscriptions. You can use in-app messaging to ask subscribers to confirm their Family Sharing settings, or implement share extensions so they can easily share your app. Within the transaction information, you can look at ownershipType to see if someone is the subscriber or a family member, so you can make sure to display your message to the person who completed the purchase.\n\nResources:\n\nTurn on Family Sharing for in-app purchases\nSupport Family Sharing in your app\nFamily Sharing for in-app purchases\nOffering subscriptions to multiple apps\n\nYou can offer auto-renewable subscriptions to access multiple apps. Each app must be approved to use auto-renewable in-app purchases and published under the same developer account.\n\nUse App Store Connect to set up separate and equivalent auto-renewable subscriptions for each app included in the multiapp subscription so that people can subscribe from any app. To help people avoid paying multiple times for the same offering, make sure to verify that they’re active subscribers before showing any subscription options. View details on determining if a subscription is active.\n\nYou can also create an app bundle to group multiple subscription apps into a single download at a reduced price. App bundles can include up to 10 of your iOS apps or up to 10 of your macOS apps.\n\nResources:\n\nApp bundle essentials\nOffer subscriptions across apps\nAttracting subscribers\n\nBy allowing people to try your subscription at the moment they’re most interested in its value, you increase the likelihood that they’ll subscribe. There are several ways you can provide a preview of the subscription experience.\n\nPresent subscription benefits during onboarding. By highlighting the value of your subscription when people first launch your app, you can educate them on how the app works and help them understand what they’ll gain from subscribing. Keep onboarding brief, engaging, and focused on the features your audience cares about, such as the ability to access the subscription across multiple device types. Provide a succinct call to action and clear subscription terms.\n\nFind out what you’ll need to include\n\nOffer a freemium app experience. A freemium app allows customers to use the app at no cost, with the option to subscribe if they want to enhance their experience or engage more deeply. A free experience lowers the barrier to try an app, and people may be more inclined to invest in paid features after having had time to enjoy the app.\n\nOffer a metered paywall. A metered paywall allows access to a finite amount of content for a specified duration before needing to make a purchase — for example, viewing 10 full articles per month for free in a news app. This gives people the opportunity to immediately start sampling your subscription experience, while encouraging them to subscribe.\n\nFor freemium and paywall experiences, include contextually relevant prompts to encourage people to subscribe — for example, when they near their monthly limit of free articles or videos. Additionally, consider making it easy to subscribe at any time by including a prompt throughout the app interface. Test and measure the impact of these prompts, and consider trying different versions of your call-to-action messaging to understand what resonates most with your audience.\n\nOptimize subscriptions for success: acquisition\n\nClearly describing subscriptions\n\nAn effective subscription purchase flow makes it simple for people to get the product or service they’re interested in. Use consistent messaging and include clear terms so people can easily recognize the value of the offer. A lengthy sign-up process will lower your subscription conversion rate, so keep the purchase flow simple and only ask for necessary information. In addition, the following details must be included in your subscription’s sign-up screen:\n\nSubscription name and duration, and the content or services provided during the subscription period\nFull renewal price, shown clearly and prominently, and localized in available currencies\nA way for current subscribers to sign in or restore purchases\n\nPlease note that your app and App Store metadata must include links to your Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nBilling amount\nIn the purchase flow, the amount that will be billed must be the most prominent pricing element in the layout. For example, an annual subscription should clearly display the total amount that will be billed upon purchase. While you may also present a breakdown price that the annual amount is equivalent to or a savings when compared to weekly or monthly subscriptions, these additional elements should be displayed in a subordinate position and size to the annual price. This ensures that people are not misled.\n\nFree trials\nIn the purchase flow for a free trial, clearly indicate how long the free trial lasts and the price billed once the free trial is over.\n\nPromoting subscriptions on the App Store\n\nYou can promote in-app purchases directly on the App Store, so people can find your subscription or introductory offer and initiate a purchase even before downloading your app. Promoted in-app purchases appear on your product page, can display in search results, and may be featured on the Today, Games, or Apps tabs. Choose to promote up to 20 in-app purchases at a time to help you effectively increase discoverability for content within your app. This can be particularly effective for letting new customers know about introductory offers.\n\nLearn about promoting your in-app purchases\n\nPromoted in-app purchases have unique metadata to communicate their value.\nProviding subscription offers\n\nYou can grow and retain your user base by giving them a free or discounted price for a specific duration for an auto-renewable subscription. At the end of the offer period, the subscription auto-renews at the standard price unless a subscriber cancels it or turns off auto-renewal. You can provide the following incentive types for subscription offers:\n\nFree trial. A subscriber can access your subscription for free for a specific duration — for example, a one-month free offer for a subscription with a standard renewal price of $4.99 per month. Their subscription begins immediately, but they won’t be billed until the offer duration ends. This offer may be useful if you want to let people experience your subscription at no immediate cost to them.\n\nPay as you go. A subscriber pays a discounted price each billing period for a specific duration — for example, $1.99 per month for three months for a subscription with a standard renewal price of $9.99 per month. Once the duration is over, they’ll be billed at the standard renewal price. This option may be useful if you want to attract price-sensitive people with a recurring discount without having to offer that discount for the lifetime of the subscription.\n\nPay up front. A subscriber pays a one-time price for a specific duration — for example, $9.99 up front for the first six months of a subscription with a standard renewal price of $39.99 per year. Once the duration is over, they’ll be billed at the standard renewal price. This offer may be useful if you want to offer an extended experience that gives people time to enjoy the subscription before the next renewal.\n\nOffer types\n\nThere are three types of subscription offers you can give to customers: introductory, promotional, and offer codes. You can provide all three offer types at once, depending on your business goals. To determine which type might be best for a particular use case, consider each offer’s intended use, customer eligibility, redemption limits, and other criteria. All offers are set up in App Store Connect, where you’ll choose the offer type, duration, pricing, and more. For details about offer types and available durations, see Pricing and Availability.\n\nComparing Subscription Offers\n \tIntroductory Offers\tPromotional Offers\tOffer Codes\nPrimary Use\tAcquiring new subscribers\tRetaining and winning back subscribers\tAcquiring, retaining, and winning back subscribers.\nCustomer Eligibility\tNew subscribers within the app\tExisting or previous subscribers within the app. Customers who have not subscribed within the app cannot complete this type of offer.\tNew, existing, or previous subscribers\nDistribution and Redemption\tDistributed and redeemed within the app or on the App Store via promoted in-app purchase\tDistributed and redeemed within the app\tDistributed through any digital or offline methods, as well as within the app. Redeemed using a direct URL or within the app. One-time-use codes can also be redeemed on the App Store.\nRedemption Limits\tA customer can redeem one introductory offer per subscription group\tYou determine how many offers a customer can redeem\tA customer can redeem one code per active offer\nOffer Limits\tOne offer per subscription, per territory\t10 active offers per subscription\t10 active offers per subscription.

You can distribute two types of offer codes however you choose using online and offline channels.\n\nOne-time-use codes: Unique, one-time-use codes that you generate in App Store Connect and people can redeem through a redemption URL, within your app (if your app supports the offerCodeRedemption or the presentCodeRedemptionSheet method), or by entering the code in the App Store code redemption flow. These codes are useful for small scale distribution or when code access needs to be restricted. They expire after a maximum of six months from the date they’re created.\n\nCustom codes: Uniquely named custom codes — for example, SPRINGPROMO — each of which people can redeem through a redemption URL or within your app (if your app supports the offerCodeRedemption or the presentCodeRedemptionSheet method). You set a maximum redemption limit and can choose whether or not to set an expiration date. Custom codes are ideal for large campaigns that require mass distribution.\n\nOffer codes can be used in a variety of ways — for example, you can:\n\nSend an email sharing the latest features and recently added content with an offer code to current or lapsed subscribers, so they can experience your service for a limited time.\nDistribute flyers that include custom codes to promote your service to event attendees.\nPartner with another company on a marketing initiative or campaign to help promote your app.\nCreate a peer-to-peer member referral program that enables current subscribers to share an offer code and receive a benefit for promoting your app. You are responsible for distributing any benefits or rewards to subscribers.\nProvide a code to a subscriber with a customer service issue to compensate for the issue and encourage retention.\nDistribute one-time-use codes within an app that you’re sunsetting as a way to transition current subscribers to your new app and promote your service.\nDisplay a save offer in your app to a subscriber who has turned off auto-renew but their subscription hasn’t expired yet.\nConfiguration\n\nWhen configuring offer codes in App Store Connect, you’ll determine customer eligibility. If new subscribers are eligible, you’ll also decide whether or not they can redeem an offer code in addition to an introductory offer. Customers can redeem only one code per offer, but may be eligible to redeem multiple offers for a single subscription, depending on your configuration choices. Be sure to consider the implications of creating multiple offers for a single subscription. One-time-use codes expire after a maximum of six months from the date they’re created, so be mindful of how many you generate at a given time. Custom code names should not contain personal information, such as a subscriber’s username.\n\nDistribution and redemption\n\nYou’ll distribute offer codes through your marketing channels, such as in-app merchandising, email, or offline campaigns. Consider which channels might be most effective at reaching your intended customers, and be sure to mention eligibility or availability limits. Customers on iOS 14.2 and iPadOS 14.2 or later can redeem offer codes through a redemption URL, or within your app if your app supports the offerCodeRedemption or the presentCodeRedemptionSheet method. They can also redeem one-time-use codes on the App Store.\n\nApple handles the redemption experience, which includes an offer details screen with the app icon, subscription display name, duration, and pricing, all of which you’ll add in App Store Connect. If you’ve previously added a promotional image for the subscription, this is shown instead of your app icon. To help people make an informed decision, make sure that these details clearly describe the subscription experience. In order for offer codes to be redeemed, your app must be available on the App Store. If someone doesn’t have your app, they’ll be able to download it during the redemption experience.\n\nIf your app’s subscription setup includes more than one subscription group, keep in mind that existing subscribers can redeem more than one offer if the offers are in different subscription groups. If you intend for someone to subscribe to only one subscription group at a time, make sure the offer is within their current subscription group. Existing subscribers can only redeem codes that are an upgrade from or at an equal level as their current subscription.\n\nAfter someone redeems an offer, be sure to provide a relevant experience based on their subscription state. For example, for a first-time subscriber, you might highlight the benefits of your subscription and provide onboarding. If your app includes account creation or requires agreement to additional terms, make this process as smooth as possible for customers who redeemed a code and are new to your app.\n\nTo get started:\n\nEnable your server to receive App Store Server Notifications.\nTo allow for code redemption within your app, use the offerCodeRedemption or the presentCodeRedemptionSheet method.\nTo learn how to identify offer code redemptions using StoreKit on the device, see the offerID and offerType transaction properties.\nTo learn how to identify offer code redemptions on your server, see the offerIdentifer and offerType properties in the responses from App Store Server API and in App Store Server Notifications.\n\nResources:\n\nSet up offer codes\nImplement offer codes\nSubscription offer codes essentials\nGet started with custom offer codes\nPromotional offers\n\nGive existing or previous subscribers a free or discounted subscription for a specific duration. These offers provide the flexibility to create unique promotions to grow and retain your customer base. They can also help win back customers who canceled their subscriptions or promote an upgrade to another subscription at a special price.\n\nYou decide the business logic for each offer and choose when to display the offer in your app using StoreKit APIs. You can have up to 10 active offers for each subscription, so you can determine which offers are most compelling and useful to customers. Make sure to consider the implications of having multiple offers in effect.\n\nUsing StoreKit or App Store server APIs, you’ll be able to identify the auto-renewal statuses of your subscribers and understand which offers might be most effective. If a subscriber has turned off auto-renewal, you might display a promotional offer for one month free in order to win them back before the end of their current subscription period. If you’ve noticed a monthly subscriber has renewed multiple times, you might provide an offer to upgrade to an annual subscription at a discounted price. You can also think about other winback or upgrade opportunities based on various user journeys. For example, consider an offer that would be most valuable for someone who cancels during a free trial versus someone who cancels after spending time on a paid subscription.\n\nGetting started:\n\nGenerate access keys in the Users and Access section of App Store Connect.\nCreate a promotional offer on your app’s in-app purchase page for each product in App Store Connect.\nDetermine your business logic and use StoreKit APIs.\nEnable App Store server notifications.\n\nResources:\n\nSet up promotional offers for auto-renewable subscriptions\nImplement promotional offers\nArchitect for subscriptions\nKeeping subscribers\n\nFor people to stay subscribed to your app, they need to continue getting value out of the subscription. Update your app regularly with new content and feature enhancements to help encourage subscribers to maintain their subscriptions.\n\nSending notifications\n\nWhen written thoughtfully, notifications can help people stay engaged with your service and keep their subscriptions active. To ensure a positive experience, make sure your notifications are timely, serve a clear purpose, and deliver meaningful information. You can also use push notifications to market your content — for example, promoting a subscription offer to people who haven’t yet subscribed. However, people must first explicitly opt in to receiving marketing push notifications via a method within your app that includes consent language and a clear way of opting out. Carefully consider the frequency, timing, and content of your notifications to ensure they always provide value to subscribers. Push notifications must not include sensitive personal or confidential information.\n\nView design guidance\nGet details on implementing notifications\n\nProviding support\n\nThoughtful customer support helps you manage relationships with your subscribers and can lead to improved engagement, higher retention, and better ratings and reviews. Use StoreKit and App Store server APIs to provide more seamless subscriber support, and to resolve issues in a more timely and efficient manner.\n\nLetting people manage their subscriptions\n\nA subscriber’s preferences may change during a subscription period. You can use the showManageSubscriptions(in:) method to let them manage their subscription within your app. By providing a dedicated place in your app to manage subscriptions, you can also display other options to complement the system-provided management UI. For example, you might show a promotional offer that provides a higher service level for a discounted price. If they cancel, you might provide an offer to help win them back and encourage them to resubscribe. Or you might present a survey where they can share feedback about their subscription experience and reasons for cancelling, which can inform your marketing strategy. To ensure a positive experience, always make it easy for people to access the system-provided management UI where they can cancel if they wish.\n\nExtending a subscription’s renewal date\n\nIn cases of service or content delivery issues — such as a server outage or technical glitch — you can extend the renewal date of a subscription using the Renewal Date Extension endpoint. For example, if a sports match is canceled or there’s an interruption to a livestreamed event, you might extend free service for a specified time in order to make up for the issue. You can move the renewal date for a customer’s subscription twice per calendar year, each up to 90 days in the future. Any days included in an extension won’t count toward the one year of paid service needed to receive an 85% proceeds rate.\n\nAlternatively, you can use offer codes to compensate dissatisfied subscribers with a free or discounted subscription for a specific period of time. These codes can be redeemed on the App Store or within your app.\n\nDetermining subscriber status\n\nThe Get All Subscription Statuses endpoint lets you determine in one simple check whether a subscription is active, expired, in billing retry, or in grace period. Use this information to inform your retention strategy and provide subscribers with relevant information within your app, such as their upcoming renewal date. You can also use this endpoint alongside the OfferID and OfferType transaction properties in StoreKit to identify offer redemptions.\n\nLearn to support customers with StoreKit 2 and the App Store Server API\nLearn to support customers and manage refunds\nLearn to help people manage their subscriptions\n\nRetaining SubscribersUpdated\n\nUse the Get All Subscription Statuses endpoint and Get Transaction History endpoint to determine the status of your users’ subscriptions and view transaction history, so you can identify and act on:\n\nVoluntary churn. Determine if a subscriber has turned off auto-renew for a particular subscription using the Get All Subscription Statuses endpoint. You can also use App Store Server Notifications to get real-time updates about changes in a user’s status and key events related to their in-app purchases, such as a change in renewal status. Use this information to take action in response. For example, you might present a promotional offer or suggest an alternate tier that better fits their needs. When a subscription expires, you can lock access to the subscription’s content or service. Be sure to inform the user of any changes and let them know if there’s anything they need to do in response and how to resubscribe if needed.\n\nInvoluntary churn. Sometimes a subscriber might experience a billing issue, such as an expired credit card, that causes their subscription to expire. Starting in iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4, if a subscription doesn’t successfully renew, a system-provided sheet appears in your app upon launch with a prompt that lets customers update the payment method for their Apple ID. If you’d like, you can choose to delay or suppress this sheet in StoreKit using messages and display.\n\nYou can learn when a subscription fails to renew using:\n\nApp Store server notifications, which sends a DID_FAIL_TO_RENEW notification type.\nStoreKit renewal state to get information about the renewal state.\nThe App Store Server API to get all subscription statuses.\n\nWhen a subscription renewal fails, Apple attempts to recover it for 60 days. If you’ve chosen to pause access to your service or content during this time, you’ll need to reinstate access once the issue is resolved. If the subscription renews within 60 days, the days of paid service resume from the renewal date.\n\nTo prevent service interruptions due to billing issues, enable Billing Grace Period in App Store Connect. Apple attempts to address the billing issue and recover the subscription while the subscriber retains subscription access. You can choose to apply Billing Grace Period to all renewals (existing paid renewals and free offers transitioning to paid renewals) or only to existing paid renewals. You can also set a duration of 3, 16, or 28 days. Be sure to consider what Billing Grace Period configuration best aligns with your business. If the subscription is recovered within the Billing Grace Period, there won’t be any interruption to the days of paid service or to your revenue. If someone resubscribes after 60 days, the days of paid service reset and you’ll receive the standard one-year subscription rate until the next year of paid service passes.\n\nPrice increase consent. When you increase the price of a subscription and Apple asks affected subscribers to agree to the new price, you can keep track of their consent status before the change takes effect. Before displaying the price increase sheet to affected users, you might show an in-app message that explains the benefits of the subscription and how the price increase improves the service. If someone doesn’t respond to the increase, their subscription expires at the end of their current billing cycle.\n\nResources:\n\nApp Store Server API\nApp Store Server Notifications\nReduce involuntary subscriber churn\nEnable Billing Grace Period\nManaging prices\n\nYou can price your auto-renewable subscriptions by storefront and choose from 800 price points across all available currencies and price tiers, with an additional 100 higher price points available upon request. After you set a starting price for your auto-renewable subscription, you can schedule one future price change at a time, per territory in App Store Connect.\n\nPrice decreases. If you decrease the price of your auto-renewable subscription, existing subscriptions will automatically renew at the lower price. You don’t have the option to preserve the higher price for existing subscribers. Existing subscribers don’t receive any communications and don’t need to take any action.\n\nPrice increases. When you increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription, Apple automatically provides push notifications, email, and in-app messaging to let subscribers know about the upcoming change and how to manage their subscription. Some price increases require subscribers to opt in, while smaller, infrequent price increases can result in notifications without the need to opt in.\n\nIf needed, you can temporarily delay the in-app price consent sheet to avoid interrupting someone during a critical moment.\n\nYou can keep an unlimited number of active subscribers at their existing price while increasing the price for new subscribers. If you don’t preserve the price for existing subscribers, and they need to consent, they must agree to the new price. If they don’t agree, their subscription expires at the end of their current billing cycle.\n\nIf you have several cohorts of subscribers at different prices and want to move all subscribers to the current price, increase the price for those paying closest to the current price first (for example, $2.99 to $3.99), then the next closest, and so on. This ensures that people don’t experience multiple price increases. Before you make any pricing decisions, research your target market’s pricing expectations and weigh the potential impact of raising the price against retaining subscribers.\n\n$3.99\n$2.99\n$1.99\n2020\n2021\n2022\nNew subscribers in 2022 will pay $3.99.\nSubscribers since 2021 continue to pay $2.99.\nSubscribers since 2020 continue to pay $1.99.\n\nResources:\n\nManage pricing for auto-renewable subscriptions\nManage auto-renewable subscription pricing in App Store Connect\nDelay the price consent sheet\nMeasuring performance with Sales and Trends\n\nView and analyze subscription data to better understand how your subscriptions are performing.

You can test up to three alternate product page versions against the original, view the results in App Analytics, and set the best performing version to display to everyone on the App Store.\n\nOverviewConfiguringMonitoringApplying\nOverview\n\nWith product page optimization, you can test different elements of your App Store product page to understand which results in the most engagement.\n\nFor example, you can find out if:\n\nShowcasing a certain character or value proposition gets better results.\nHighlighting a particular feature or culturally relevant content boosts downloads in a certain location.\nChanging your app icon to a different style or color results in increased conversion.\nIncluding seasonal content leads to more downloads.\n\nAlternate versions of your product page (called “treatments”) are shown to a percentage of randomly-selected people on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, or later. People who see a particular treatment will see the same one across the App Store for the duration of your test. If someone downloads your app from a treatment that has an alternate app icon, this icon will also display on their device. Like your original product page, the metadata in your treatments can appear on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs, as well as in search results.\n\nYou’ll be able to view and compare how each treatment performs against your original product page and use this insight to optimize your product page. Apps that are available for pre-order can also use product page optimization.\n\nLearn about creating app icons, screenshots, and previews\n\nConfiguring a test\n\nWhen creating a test in App Store Connect, you’ll provide a reference name and select the number of treatments, traffic proportion, and localizations. You’ll get an estimate of how long it might take for your test to reach your desired improvement in conversion rate based on recent traffic to your app’s product page. One test can be active at a time and you won’t be able to change it once it’s started. A test runs up to 90 days, unless you choose to stop it. You can also use the App Store Connect API to automate metadata upload and submission for product page optimization.\n\nLearn how to create a test\n\nProvide a reference name. Name your test in up to 64 characters. Be descriptive so you can easily identify your test when viewing results in App Analytics — for example, “Spring 2022 Icon Color Test with 3 icons.”\n\nSelect the number of treatments. A test can include up to three treatments with alternate app icons, screenshots, and app previews.\n\nChoose your traffic proportion. Select the percentage of people who will be selected at random to be shown a treatment instead of your original App Store product page. For example, if you allocate 40% of your traffic to your test and have two treatments, each treatment receives 20% of your total traffic and your original product page receives the remaining 60% of your total traffic. People will see the same treatment whenever they visit the App Store throughout the duration of the test.\n\nSelect localizations. Each treatment can be localized in all of the languages that your app supports, or just a few that you choose. Keep in mind that your test may take longer to reach meaningful results, depending on the localizations you’ve selected.\n\nEstimate your test duration. While this step is optional, it can help you understand if you’re likely to reach your desired conversion rate within 90 days. To see how long it might take to reach your goal, choose your desired improvement in conversion rate. Your app’s existing performance data, such as daily impressions and new downloads, are used to generate this estimate. Based on this selected conversion rate, you’ll see the estimated test duration and the number of impressions you’d need to reach an outcome with at least 90% confidence in the results. This estimate is provided as a guide and won’t impact the test. A test runs for 90 days or until you manually stop it within that time. If the estimate is more than 90 days, you may want to change your criteria — for example, by creating fewer treatments or increasing traffic allocation.\n\nSet up test treatments. By default, each treatment includes your original app icon, screenshots, and app previews unless you provide alternate metadata. Consider how many elements you change in a treatment so you can more easily determine which one led to a particular result. Keep in mind that the more treatments you include in a test, the longer it may take to reach conclusive results.\n\nBefore your test can be published, any new metadata included in your treatments must be approved by App Review. Treatments that only include alternate screenshots and app previews can be submitted for review independent of a new app version. To test any alternate app icons, all variants of your icon must be included in the binary of your published app and must be built using Xcode 13 or later.\n\nLearn how to configure treatments\n\nMonitoring your test\n\nVisit App Analytics in App Store Connect to understand your test’s performance and evaluate whether to apply a treatment to your original product page. You can view performance metrics starting the day after the test begins. For each treatment, App Analytics displays the number of impressions, conversion rate, percent improvement, and confidence level compared to your chosen baseline. By default, the baseline is your original product page. If your test includes multiple treatments, you can compare their performance to one another by changing the baseline at any time.\n\nIn addition, indicators will appear throughout the duration of the test to help you understand its current status. For example, the dashboard will show if the test still needs to collect more data and whether one of your treatments is performing better or worse than the baseline.\n\nView product page optimization terms and definitions\n\nApplying a treatment\n\nBased on the results of your test, you may want to apply a treatment to your original product page so that it displays to everyone on the App Store. Please note that applying a treatment while your test is still running will end your test. Before applying a treatment or stopping your test, we recommend waiting until at least one treatment is declared to be performing better or worse than the baseline, with at least 90% confidence.\n\nIf the treatment you want to apply includes an alternate app icon, you’ll need to include the icon when you submit a new app version in App Store Connect.\n\nLearn how to apply a treatment\n\nResources\nCreate a test\nConfigure test treatments\nProduct page optimization terms and definitions\nApply a test treatment to your product page\nCreating your product page\nCustom product pages"

People can discover your in-app events right on the App Store on iOS and iPadOS, giving you an entirely new way to showcase your events and expand their reach — whether you’d like to reach new users, keep your current users informed, or reconnect with previous users.\n\nDiscovery on the App Store\n\nOn iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 and later, in-app events appear across the App Store as event cards that include images or video, the event name, and a short description. People can tap to open an event details page, which provides a more immersive experience with a longer event description and notes if an in-app purchase or subscription is required to participate. From this page, they can share your event with others — for example, via Messages or social media. And they can opt in on the event card and event details page to receive a notification from the App Store when your event starts.\n\nIf someone doesn’t have your app or game, they can download it directly from your in-app event card or event details page.

When creating an event, you’ll enter a reference name (visible only in App Store Connect) and event information, including metadata. You’ll also select an event badge and regional availability. You can submit events for review independent of a new app version and have up to ten approved events in App Store Connect at a time. You can also use the App Store Connect API to automate metadata upload and submission for your events. An app can have up to five events published on the App Store at a time.\n\nGood candidates for in-app events are challenges, competitions, or special content launches.\n\nThe following are not good candidates for in-app events:\n\nRepetitive activities such as daily tasks or rewards.\nPrice promotions that don’t introduce any new content, features, or goods.\nGeneral promotions that raise awareness about your app or game. While an in-app event can highlight added content or features that are permanent or ongoing, the event itself should focus on a related limited-time moment or experience.\nChoosing an event badge\n\nSelect the badge that best fits the type of event you’re offering to display above the title on the in-app event card and event details page.\n\nChallenge: Activities encouraging the user to achieve a goal before the event ends — for example, a fitness challenge in a workout app or beating a certain number of levels in a game.\nCompetition: Activities in which users compete against one another for the highest ranking or to win rewards — for example, a tournament where players battle to win the most matches.\nLive Event: Activities that occur in real-time that all users can experience simultaneously — for example, a sports match or livestreamed concert. These events should provide users with new content, features, or goods.\nMajor Update: Introducing significant new features, content, or experiences – for example, the launch of new game modes or levels. These events go beyond minor enhancements like UI adjustments or bug fixes.\nNew Season: Introducing new content, storylines, or media libraries to build on established content. For example, a significant sporting event, a battle pass or themed content in a game, or a special episode of a television show. These events should focus on unique content rather than promoting awareness about the entirety of the season.\nPremiere: Introducing new content or media for the first time — for example, a movie debut or newly released audio. These events should focus on the introduction of this unique content, rather than promoting general awareness about your app’s content or service.\nSpecial Event: Limited-time events that are not captured by another event badge, possibly spanning multiple activities or experiences — for example, an event featuring a collaboration. These events should provide users with new content, features, or goods.\nCreating effective metadata\n\nThe metadata you provide is used when displaying your event across the App Store. To ensure a smooth review experience, make sure it accurately portrays your event and is specific to the event experience, rather than sharing general information about your app or promoting its content or services. You’ll enter the following:\n\nEvent name: Choose a distinctive, unique name that’s up to 30 characters long and written in title case. This should be the actual name of the event, such as “June Leaderboard Climb,” rather than a call to action or tagline, such as “Watch the livestream.” Avoid generic terms or describing the type of event, since the event badge already displays this information.\n\nShort description: Briefly summarize your in-app event in up to 50 characters written in sentence case. This information displays on your event card.\n\nLong description: Provide more information about your event — such as potential rewards — in up to 120 characters written in sentence case. This information displays on your event details page.\n\nEvent card and event details media: Add an image or video that represents your in-app event across the App Store. Videos autoplay and repeat, so aim to create a seamless loop. In App Store Connect, you can preview what your provided media will look like in an event card and event details page to confirm that crucial aspects of your image or video will not be obscured.\n\nTo ensure your events display properly on the App Store and provide a high-quality user experience, consider these guidelines when creating your metadata:\n\nUse proper capitalization and punctuation. Avoid using all capitals and don’t use excessive punctuation marks, such as multiple exclamation points.\nAvoid claims that can’t be verified, such as “the best” or “#1,” as well as extra words, such as “game event.”\nDon’t include specific prices in your metadata, as pricing and currencies can vary across regions and can be changed independent of your event. Including specific pricing will lead to rejection by App Store Review.\nWhen possible, avoid using text or logos in your media, especially if they include your event name or app name.\nConsider using video in order to provide users with a more dynamic preview of your event.\nDon’t add borders or gradients to your media. Crops and gradients are automatically applied to your media in order to ensure consistency across the App Store.\nAim to create visual continuity across your event card and event details page by using similar colors or illustration styles.\nMake sure your metadata includes content that you created or have a license to use.\nDo\nEvent Card\nUse title case.\nChoose a name that accurately describes the event.\nUse sentence case and describe the event experience.\nDon’t\nEvent Card\nAvoid using text or logos in your media.\n\nDon’t use a call to action as the name.\n\nAvoid using all capitals.\n\nDon’t use multiple punctuation points.\n\nDon’t use the description to promote your app or services.\nAdding event details\n\nWhen configuring your event, you’ll also add additional event details that impact how your in-app event displays on the App Store.\n\nDetermine event availability. When you select start and end dates and times for your in-app event, you’ll also choose the date and time it appears on the App Store. An in-app event can last up to 31 days and be promoted up to 14 days before its start date. If you’d like, you can make your event available only in specific regions and customize the dates and times for each location.\n\nProvide an event deep link. This link takes users who tap Open on the in-app event card or details page to the event content within your app. This can be a universal link (recommended for security) or custom URL. Avoid using URL shorteners and other services that add unnecessary redirects. Test the deep link to make sure it directs to the proper destination within your app — for example, you can paste your URL into the Notes app and tap it. Learn about configuring universal links.\n\nBe thoughtful about the most relevant destination to direct users. If your event is live, you can link directly to the event. If your event hasn’t started, you might direct users to a landing page that builds anticipation and reminds them when to return. If a user is new to your app, consider taking them through any necessary onboarding before directing them to the event. Always provide a way for users to return to your main app experience.\n\nIndicate your event purpose. Offering in-app events in your app or game can encourage new users to try it, provide existing users with new ways to enjoy your app, and give former users reasons to return. Many in-app events are appropriate for all of these purposes, but you may create in-app events that are primarily intended for one of these reasons. Choose the option that best fits your event’s purpose:\n\nAppropriate for all users\nAttract new users: New users are people who have never downloaded your app\nKeep active users informed: Active users are people who downloaded your app and have opened it recently\nBring back lapsed users: Lapsed users are people who downloaded your app but have not opened it recently\n\nThis selection is one of the factors that the App Store uses to offer personalized recommendations and doesn’t display on your event card or event details page. To help your event reach the people it’s intended for, the App Store incorporates app usage information. This data is processed on the device to minimize data collection and enhance user privacy. Regardless of the event purpose you choose, your published events are discoverable on the App Store by all customers.\n\nDesignate event priority. Events appear on your product page chronologically based on start time, with the soonest start time displaying first. Any events you select as high priority will appear ahead of normal priority events.\n\nSelect cost. Indicate if a specific in-app purchase is required to participate in the event, as this information is shown on your event details page. For subscription apps, you only need to indicate that an in-app purchase is required when there’s an additional cost for the event specifically — for example, a pay-per-view event in a subscription app that requires an in-app purchase in addition to the standard subscription.\n\nImage and video specifications\nMedia type\tSupported extensions\tAspect ratio\tMin size/resolution\tMax size/resolution\nEvent card image\t.jpg, .jpeg, .png\t16:9\t1920x1080 px\t3840x2160 px\nEvent card video\t.mov, m4v, .mp4\t16:9\t1920x1080 px 30 fps or 60 fps\t3840x2160 px 30 fps or 60 fps\nEvent detail page image\t.jpg, .jpeg, .png\t9:16\t1080x1920 px\t2160x3840 px\nEvent detail page video\t.mov, .m4v, .mp4\t9:16\t1080x1920 px 30 fps or 60 fps\t2160x3840 px 30 fps or 60 fps\nMeasuring event performance\n\nYou can use App Analytics in App Store Connect to understand the performance of your published in-app events. You’ll be able to:\n\nDetermine which events are best at acquiring app users by viewing downloads and filtering by a specific event.\nLearn where users discover your events by viewing acquisition sources.\nUnderstand how well your event page engages users by viewing engagement data, such as event impressions, event details page views, and app opens.\nMonitor interest in your event by understanding how many users chose to be notified when your event starts."

    "title": "Peer Group Benchmarks - App Store - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/peer-group-benchmarks/",
    "html": "Take action on insights from peer group benchmarks\n\nWith data from the entire catalog of apps on the App Store, peer group benchmarks provide accurate, relevant, and privacy-preserving comparisons for apps across categories, business models, and download volumes. Learn how to take advantage of these insights to improve your app’s performance.\n\nHow it works\n\nWith peer group benchmarks in App Analytics, you can put your app’s performance into context by comparing it to that of similar apps on the App Store. Compare your results across several key metrics, including conversion rate, day 1, day 7, and day 28 retention rate, crash rate, and average proceeds per paying user to understand your app’s performance across the customer journey. Peer group benchmark metrics are defined in the same way as the standard app metrics in App Analytics and are displayed in weekly intervals.\n\nGet relevant comparisons\n\nPeer groups are created using a number of different attributes to help ensure you can compare your app’s performance to the most relevant benchmark:\n\nApp Store category\n\nApps in the same App Store category are grouped together in the same peer group. You’ll be able to view benchmarks for each App Store category you belong to, as long as there are enough apps in that peer group to ensure individual app performance is protected, and your app won’t be included in a category that you haven’t assigned to your app. You can view which App Store categories your app is included in by reviewing your app information in App Store Connect.\n\nApp Store business model\n\nApps with the same business model are grouped together in the same peer group. The available business models are free, freemium, paid, paymium, and subscriptions. Apps with in‑app purchases are considered freemium or paymium. Apps that have an associated cost to download are considered paid or paymium. In order to be considered part of the subscription business model, a freemium or paymium app must generate at least 50% of its revenue from auto-renewable subscriptions.\n\nApp Store download volume\n\nApps with similar levels of download volume in a given week are grouped together into low download volume, medium download volume, and high download volume peer groups. Apps are placed into these groups based on the number of first-time downloads and re-downloads they have compared to the rest of the apps in the peer group.\n\nLearn how to view benchmark data\n\nTake action\n\nIf there’s a particular metric that you want to improve, you can take advantage of helpful tools and capabilities in App Store Connect, such as product page optimization, custom product pages, and TestFlight. Here are some options to consider:\n\nImproving conversion rate\n\nThe conversion rate metric helps you understand how often people download your app after viewing it on the App Store. A higher conversion rate means you’re able to acquire users more efficiently. For example, if your app was viewed on the App Store on 100 devices for a certain period of time, and 25 people downloaded or redownloaded it, your conversion rate is 25%.\n\nSet up a product page optimization test\n\nCompare different app icons, screenshots, and app previews on your App Store product page to find out which assets resonate with people most. You can test up to three alternate product page versions against the original, view the results in App Analytics, and set the best performing version to display to everyone on the App Store. For example, you might see if changing your app icon to a different style or color results in increased conversion.\n\nLearn about product page optimization\n\nCreate custom product pages\n\nUse custom product pages to create additional versions of your App Store product page that showcase different features or content within your app — such as a particular sport, character, show, or gameplay feature — and share them with different audiences through unique URLs.\n\nLearn about custom product pages\n\nLocalize your app and product page\n\nLocalizing your app helps make it relevant to a variety of cultures and languages, and provides an opportunity to grow your business. Consider localizing your app and product page to support different languages and appeal to local audiences.\n\nLearn about localization\n\nImproving proceeds per paying user\n\nA paying user is a unique user, based on Apple ID, who paid for an app or in‑app purchase. Proceeds per paying user are calculated as the estimated amount you’ll receive for sales of your apps and in‑app purchases divided by your app’s total number of paying users for the selected period. For example, if your app’s total proceeds for a period are $100, and your app has 100 paying users, your proceeds per paying user are $1.\n\nEvaluate your pricing strategy\n\nIf your proceeds per paying user are below that of your peer group, consider re-assessing your in‑app purchase pricing to decide whether a different price point might be appropriate. For auto-renewable subscriptions, you might view results by territory in App Analytics to evaluate whether setting different prices per region may help increase the number of repeat payers or your revenue per transaction.\n\nLearn about managing prices for auto-renewable subscriptions\n\nIdentify your best sources\n\nUse App Analytics to identify sources that drive the most proceeds per paying user and focus your marketing and acquisition efforts on those channels.\n\nDemonstrate the value of in‑app purchases\n\nIf your app or game offers consumable in‑app purchases, consider giving your users items for free during their onboarding experience. You might show them how to use it so they can understand the value and benefit, which might encourage a future purchase. You can also review the Human Interface Guidelines to get design best practices on offering in‑app purchases.\n\nLearn about design best practices for offering in-app purchases\n\nImproving crash rate\n\nThe crash rate is the average number of crashes per session for the selected period. For example, if your app had 10 crashes and 100 sessions for the selected period, your crash rate would be 10%.\n\nPinpoint potential issues\n\nView crash and deletion data in App Analytics by platform, app version, and operating system version to pinpoint potential causes and create a better user experience. You can find more detailed crash logs in Xcode.\n\nLearn about viewing metrics in App Analytics\n\nLearn about viewing crash logs in Xcode\n\nUse TestFlight to collect user feedback\n\nTestFlight makes it easy to invite users to test your apps and App Clips and collect valuable feedback before releasing your apps on the App Store. You can invite up to 10,000 testers using just their email address or by sharing a public link.\n\nLearn about TestFlight\n\nImproving user retention\n\nRetention measures how often users come back to engage with your app over time. It’s calculated by dividing the number of devices that opened your app in the days after downloading it by the total number of devices that downloaded it on the same day, and opened the app in the last 30 days. For example, if your app was first downloaded on 100 devices on May 1, and 20 devices are still active with at least one session on May 8, the day 7 retention rate on May 8 is 20%.\n\nOffer in‑app events to encourage engagement\n\nCreate in‑app events to highlight new, timely content updates in your app or game. People can discover your in‑app events right on the App Store on iOS and iPadOS, so you can showcase your events and expand their reach — whether you’d like to find new users, keep your current users informed, or reconnect with previous users.\n\nLearn about in-app events\n\nReview your app’s onboarding experience\n\nMake sure your onboarding flow successfully explains how to use your app and describes the value it provides.\n\nLearn about designing a great onboarding experience\n\nData privacy\n\nAt Apple, we build privacy protections into each of our products and services, including peer group benchmarks in App Store Connect. Peer group benchmark values are only used to provide you with relevant comparisons that help you improve your apps. When creating peer group values, we use a technique called differential privacy, which is the gold standard for ensuring that individual values within a group remain private. Every week, we ensure that each peer group has at least a certain number of apps before it’s released, and we add a certain amount of noise to each data point to provide an extra layer of protection. Apple’s own apps are also included where the customer journey is directly comparable to help create a full and complete picture of performance for a particular category, business model, and download volume tier.\n\nPeer group benchmarks are based off App Store, app usage, and transaction data from devices running a minimum of iOS 8, macOS 11, or tvOS 9. Peer group benchmarks only use app usage data from users who’ve agreed to share their app analytics with app developers.\n\nResources\nGain insights with analytics\nApp Store Connect Help: View peer group benchmarks\nApp Store Connect Help: Performance metrics\nDiscover Benchmarks in App Analytics"

Here are a few key things to keep in mind:\n\nChoose a simple and unique name\n\nSelect one that’s memorable, easy to spell, and hints at what your app does in under 30 characters.\n\nDesign a great app icon\n\nYour app icon should make a great first impression. Explore these design best practices to learn more about creating something that’s simple and recognizable. Once you’re ready to upload, follow these these step-by-step instructions.\n\nCreate compelling screenshots and app previews\n\nCommunicate your app’s user experience by adding captures from your app’s UI. Be sure to follow the screenshot and app preview specifications when uploading assets to App Store Connect.\n\nCraft copy that connects\n\nWords matter. Use your subtitle, description, and promotional text to effortlessly communicate the value of your app or game in your brand’s tone of voice.\n\nAdd your app privacy details\n\nProduct pages are where people can learn about some of the data types the app may collect, and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them. You’ll need to provide the required information about your app’s privacy practices — including the practices of third-party partners whose code you integrate into your app. Learn more about app privacy details on the App Store and manage your app privacy information in App Store Connect.\n\nConfigure any In-App Purchases\n\nIn-App Purchases let you offer extra content and features — including digital goods, subscriptions, and premium content — within your app. You can configure four types of In-App Purchases in App Store Connect: consumable, non-consumable, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewing subscriptions.\n\nIn-App Purchase page\nOverview for configuring In-App Purchases\nHuman Interface Guidelines: In-App Purchase\nAuto-renewable subscriptions\nUpload your build\n\nBefore you can distribute your app or game on the App Store, you’ll need to upload your build. A build is the code, resources, and design of your app that are packaged together for testing or distribution purposes. When you upload a build for the first time, Apple will process it before it appears in App Store Connect, and you’ll receive an email when the process is complete.\n\nChoose a build to submit\nUpload builds\nView builds and metadata\nTest your app\n\nYou’re almost there! But before submitting your app for review, you’ll want to test it thoroughly. When testing your app, pay special attention to:\n\nBugs or performance issues\nBroken links\nImproperly configured In-App Purchases\nText truncation, incorrect symbols, formatting errors, or localization issues\nTest your app using TestFlight\n\nTestFlight, Apple’s beta testing service, lets testers install, test, and provide feedback about your app. To get started, upload your build, add test information, and invite testers. Testers can be internal users from your team or external testers who you’ve invited via email or public link. You can also gather feedback from the Apple developer community on beta versions of your app by sharing your public link in the Apple Developer Forums.\n\nTo start testing and providing feedback, testers will use the TestFlight app to accept your invite and download your beta app. They can share screenshot or crash feedback, which you’ll be able to see in TestFlight or Xcode Organizer and use to improve your app. Learn how beta testing is simple with TestFlight.\n\nGet started with TestFlight\nTest your In-App Purchases\n\nApple provides test environments in Xcode and the Apple sandbox to help you test your In-App Purchase implementations. For early development, continuous integration, and debugging, you can use StoreKit Testing in Xcode. And you can use sandbox for testing scenarios using In-App Purchase data you set up in App Store Connect.\n\nExplore testing In-App Purchases\nRelated documentation\nTesting at all stages of development with Xcode and the sandbox\nStoreKit Test\nTesting In-App Purchases with sandbox\nSubmit your app for distribution on the App Store\n\nApple reviews all apps, app updates, app bundles, In-App Purchases, and In-App Events to ensure they’re reliable, perform as expected, and provide a safe and trusted experience for users. Before you submit for review, make sure to:\n\nLearn more about the app review process.\nReview the App Review Guidelines.\nAdd all required app review information in App Store Connect.\n\nWhen you’re ready, go to the Apps section of App Store Connect, select your app, add the appropriate build for review, and then submit it. Once submitted, your app status will change to “In Review.” You can also use the App Store Connect API — which enables the automation of actions you take in App Store Connect — to enable automatic submission of your app. Once your app has been approved and is ready for distribution on the App Store, its status will change to “Ready for Distribution.”\n\nMeasure success\n\nOnce you’ve started distributing your app or game on the App Store, you can use App Analytics, Sales and Trends, and Payments and Financial Reports to get data about your performance in App Store Connect. These tools are included with Apple Developer Program membership and require no technical implementation.\n\nMonitor your user acquisition and engagement\n\nUse App Analytics to learn how people are downloading and engaging with your app or game, as well as dig into conversion rate, sessions per active device, and retention rates.\n\nMeasure and improve acquisition with App Analytics\nCompare your app to its peers\n\nUse peer group benchmarks in App Analytics to put your app’s performance into context by comparing it to similar apps on the App Store. Compare your results across the customer journey including conversion rate, crash rate, and average proceeds per paying user. Once you’ve reviewed your performance, you can take action.\n\nUnderstand your proceeds\n\nIf you offer a paid app or any In-App Purchases, use Payments and Financial Reports to view your payments and proceeds and download financial reports.\n\nApp Store Connect Analytics\nMeasuring App Performance\nApp Store Connect Help: analytics and reporting overview\nApple Developer Forums: Analytics & Reporting\nGo further\n\nCongratulations — you’re published on the App Store! Now it’s time to keep things going by promoting your app, keeping people engaged, and refining your product page.\n\nGet started with app discovery and marketing\nPromote your app\n\nUse your marketing channels to promote your app and direct people to your product page. Learn about discovery on the App Store and ways to promote your app. You can also:\n\nShare your story with us. Use the App Store promote form to share your new apps, games, significant updates, in-app events, and great stories with our editorial team for featuring consideration on the App Store.\n\nApp Store promote form\nGetting featured on the App Store\n\nGet custom marketing assets. Share your app on social media or web banners. Use our App Store marketing tools to search for your app, choose a template, customize your design, and add preset messages in multiple languages.\n\nApp Store marketing tools\n\nTry Apple Search Ads. Help people discover your app on the App Store and match customers with your app at the right moments with Apple Search Ads.\n\nApple Search Ads\nDrive further engagement\n\nAs you continue to build and grow your app, you’ll update it and explore additional methods of promotion.\n\nUpdate your app\n\nWhen you’re ready to distribute a new version of your app, you’ll create it under the original app record you made in App Store Connect. You can also create a new version using the App Store Connect API.\n\nCreate a new version\nCreate an App Store version using the App Store Connect API\nLocalize for new markets\n\nAttract people from around the world by localizing your app and product page to support additional languages.\n\nExpanding your app to new markets\nLocalizing app information\nAsk for ratings and reviews\n\nRating and reviews on your App Store product page can improve your app’s discoverability and encourage downloads. Ratings are on a scale of one to five stars, while reviews are written responses. Monitor ratings and consider responding to reviews to build rapport with your users.\n\nRatings, reviews, and responses\nMonitor ratings\nOffer In-App Events\n\nThese are timely events within apps and games — such as game competitions, movie premieres, livestreamed experiences, and more — that people can discover right on the App Store. In-App Events appear on your product page and can also display on the Today, Apps, and Games tabs, as well as on the Search tab.\n\nIn-App Events\nOffer In-App Events\nMake the most of your product page\n\nUse App Store features to provide an even more relevant experience for people on the App Store.\n\nCreate custom product pages: In addition to your default product page, you can create up to 35 custom product pages to showcase a particular feature, content, character, or gameplay. Each custom product page can have unique screenshots, promotional text, and app previews. And you can share each page with different audiences through unique URLs or use them in Apple Search Ads campaigns.\n\nGet started with custom product pages\nRelated documentation\nCustom product pages\nConfigure custom product pages in App Store Connect\n\nUse product page optimization: Test different elements of your App Store product page to find out if:\n\nShowcasing a certain character or value proposition gets better results, such as more app downloads.\nHighlighting a particular feature or culturally relevant content boosts downloads in a certain location.\nChanging your app icon results in increased conversion.\nIncluding seasonal content leads to more downloads.\n\nThese different elements are tested on alternate versions of your product page called “treatments” and are shown to a percentage of randomly selected people on the App Store. You can also set up a product page optimization test in App Store Connect, under the distribution section of your selected app.\n\nGet started with product page optimization\nRelated documentation\nProduct page optimization\nCreate a test in App Store Connect\nKeep learning\n\nExplore effective ways to increase your app or games discovery and grow your business on the App Store.\n\nLearn more about the App Store\nExplore App Store developer features\nDiscover more\nLearn to Code\n\nDiscover the tools that can help students express themselves and prepare for the future.\n\nLearn more\nMeet with Apple Experts\n\nJoin us for sessions, workshops, labs, and consultations — tailored for you.\n\nLearn more\nApple Developer Centers\n\nThe home for in-person events and activities around the world.\n\nLearn more\nApple Entrepreneur Camp\n\nTake part in a one-on-one technology lab for underrepresented founders and developers with app-driven businesses.\n\nLearn more\nApple Developer support\n\nGet help with tools and technologies.\n\nLearn more\nWWDC\n\nJoin us online for the biggest developer event of the year.\n\nLearn more"

    "html": "What’s new\n\nUse the latest capabilities to improve the discovery of your app on the App Store, and deliver high-quality app and in-app purchase experiences.\n\nAdAttributionKit framework\n\nAdAttributionKit, a new framework that lets registered advertisers attribute their advertising efforts across multiple sources — all while maintaining user privacy. AdAttributionKit includes:\n\nApp AdAttributionKit, which lets advertising networks attribute app installations to a particular campaign. This builds on the functionality of SKAdNetwork.\nWeb AdAttributionKit, which lets ad networks measure the efficacy of ad clicks within iOS or iPadOS apps that navigate to a website. This builds on the functionality of Private Click Measurement.\n\nAdvertisers can use this framework to receive enhanced attribution information across campaign channels, allowing them to better optimize their efforts.\n\nLearn about measuring advertising success with AdAttributionKit\n\nStoreKit views\n\nWith new SwiftUI views provided by StoreKit, it’s easier than ever to create merchandising experiences for in-app purchases and subscriptions. Take advantage of three different StoreKit views to showcase your products across Apple platforms; StoreView, ProductView, and SubscriptionStoreView help you get up and running with merchandising faster than ever. With as little as one line of code, the description, price, and duration for each level of service are clearly presented to the user.\n\nOffer in-app purchases in different languages and currencies with built-in localization support.\nEasily provide secure in-app purchase experiences that follow Apple’s design best practices.\nCustomize StoreKit views to match the look and feel of your app.\n\nWatch the latest video\n\nTestFlight\n\nMake the most of the beta testing process in TestFlight with updates to tester management capabilities that help you better understand your testers and get valuable new details.\n\nFilter and sort testers by their level of engagement, indicated by app sessions, app crashes, and volume of feedback.\nView the most recently installed device type and OS used by testers when testing your app.\nPerform key actions for multiple testers at once.\n\nThese features are also supported by the App Store Connect API.\n\nLearn about TestFlight\n\nGame Center\n\nGame Center is Apple’s social gaming network, designed to help players experience the joy of games with their friends.\n\nMultiplayer improvements\n\nCustomize your matchmaking rules in multiplayer matches. For example, you can automatch players based on skill or region for a better multiplayer experience. Additional enhancements improve the speed and reliability of multiplayer matches.\n\nAchievement rarity\n\nPlayers can view the number of other players who’ve unlocked a particular achievement, so they’ll stay motivated and excited about what they’ve accomplished.\n\nConfiguration improvements\n\nSet up and manage achievements and leaderboards more easily with enhanced Game Center tools and APIs.\n\nArchive achievements and leaderboards you no longer want to display.\nConfigure and manage achievement and leaderboard metadata.\nSubmit score and achievement data directly to Game Center.\n\nLearn about Game Center\n\nPre-orders by region\n\nOffering your app for pre-order is a great way to build awareness and excitement for your upcoming releases on the App Store. And now you can offer pre-orders on a regional basis. People can pre-order your app in a set of regions that you choose, even while it’s available for download in other regions at the same time. With this new flexibility, you can expand your app into new regions by offering it as a pre-order and set different release dates for each region.\n\nApp privacy details\n\nAn important part of submitting your app to the App Store is explaining how your app handles user data. Two new updates make it easier to accurately provide Privacy Nutrition Labels and improve the integrity of the software supply chain: signatures for third-party SDKs and privacy manifests. In addition, we’re adding more data type options to use in your Privacy Nutrition Label when describing what types of data your app collects.\n\nRead more\n\nWatch the latest videos\n\nProduct page optimization\n\nProduct page optimization lets you test different elements of your App Store product page to understand which results in the most engagement. Now you can release a new app version without interrupting a running test, providing more flexibility for your app release schedule.\n\nWatch the latest video\n\nApp Store Server API\n\nApp Store Server updates make it simpler to query for transactional data, interpret subscription statuses, and manage notifications. The new App Store Server Library helps you use best practices for handling purchase data that comes from notifications and App Store endpoints. This code sample is designed to use App Store Server API endpoints, verify App Store signed data, and assist with migrating away from using verifyReceipt.\n\nWatch the latest video\n\nIn-app purchase testing enhancements\n\nSeveral enhancements help you test your in-app purchase experiences throughout the development process. Improvements to StoreKit testing in Xcode, the Apple sandbox environment, and TestFlight help you test even more customer experiences. Additional testing controls help test changing subscription states, Family Sharing, and server notifications.\n\nWatch the latest video\n\nIn-app billing resolution sheet\n\nNow it’s even easier for your customers to resolve payment issues, so they can stay subscribed to your content, services, and premium features. Starting in iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4, if an auto-renewable subscription doesn’t renew due to a billing issue, a system-provided sheet appears in your app upon launch with a prompt that lets customers update their payment method for their Apple ID. No action is required to adopt this feature. You can get familiar with the sheet in Sandbox, as well as test delaying or suppressing it using messages and display in StoreKit.\n\nAll of this builds on existing App Store features that help you retain subscribers. For example, if a subscription is in the billing retry state, Apple uses machine learning to optimize payment retries for the best possible recovery rate. And when you enable Billing Grace Period, customers can continue accessing their subscriptions while Apple attempts to collect payment.\n\nLearn more\n\nLearn about retaining subscribers"

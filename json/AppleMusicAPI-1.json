    "html": "Overview\n\nApple Music API requires the inclusion of a Music User Token for any requests for data specific to an Apple Music subscriber, such as to fetch content from the user’s library. The way to configure your requests to Apple Music API with a valid Music User Token depends on the platform for your app.\n\nAutomatic Music User Token Management\n\nMusicKit automatically manages Music User Token for Apple platforms and for web apps. If you’re developing an app for Apple platforms (iOS, tvOS, watchOS, or macOS), use MusicKit for Swift to integrate with Apple Music. The framework automatically decorates requests to Apple Music API with a valid Music User Token.\n\nSimilarly, if you’re developing a web app, MusicKit on the Web automatically decorates requests to Apple Music API with a valid Music User Token.\n\nManual Music User Token Management for Android\n\nAutomatic Music User Token management is not available for Android. If you’re developing an app for Android, please refer to the authentication section of the MusicKit for Android’s documentation to learn more about how to retrieve a Music User Token.\n\nOnce you’ve successfully retrieved a Music User Token, make sure to include it in your HTTP requests to Apple Music API with the Music-User-Token header.\n\nBelow is an example of issuing a personalized request to Apple Music API using curl.\n\ncurl -v -H 'Authorization: Bearer [developer token]' -H 'Music-User-Token: [music user token]' \"https://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/library/songs\"\n\n\nFor more information about requests, responses, and error handling, see Handling Requests and Responses.\n\nSee Also\nEssentials\nGenerating Developer Tokens\nGenerate a developer token needed to make requests to Apple Music API.\nHandling Requests and Responses\nWrite a request and handle responses from the API.\nHandling Resource Representation and Relationships\nFetch resources with extended attributes and included relationships and relationship views.\nStorefronts and Localization\nPick a region-specific geographic location from which to retrieve catalog information, or retrieve information from the user’s personal library.\nCommon Objects\nUnderstand the common JSON objects that framework responses contain.\nManaging Content Ratings, Alternate Versions, and Equivalencies\nHandle multiple and alternate versions of content.\nFetching Resources by Page\nUse pagination to fetch the next set of objects."

    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/managing_content_ratings_alternate_versions_and_equivalencies",
    "html": "Overview\n\nThe Music API can fetch multiple, alternate versions of albums, songs, and music videos that are available simultaneously on a specific Storefront. For example, these alternates may represent deluxe, remastered, and reissued versions, as well as separate options for tracks with a clean or explicit rating.\n\nContent Ratings\n\nIn the Music Catalog, some albums, songs, and music videos may have a content rating. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) provides ‘explicit’ ratings. The ‘clean’ value demarcates tracks that have an ‘explicit’-rated equivalent. Apple Music API can attempt to find clean substitutions for explicit content in some contexts, such as an artist’s releases and tracks on a playlist. See below about substituting clean content with equivalents when available.\n\nFetch Equivalent Content for a Storefront\n\nUse equivalencies to find the best-available equivalent match for the requested content from a given storefront. A response from a filter equivalencies endpoint returns the best match of an album, song, or music video for the specified storefront.\n\nAlbums and tracks are sometimes made available as different versions between storefronts. Use equivalencies to find the best-available version in one storefront for an identifier found in another storefront. For instance, an album could have different identifiers between two separate storefronts. These identifiers represent different versions of the same album. For example, you can filter on equivalents by using an album’s identifier in the US (us) storefront to find its equivalent in the Japan (jp) storefront.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/jp/albums?filter[equivalents]=1500951604\n\n\nSubstitute Content with Clean Equivalents When Available\n\nBased on a user’s preference, you may want to only include clean versions of content. In addition to the above equivalencies for albums, songs, and music videos, you can also apply this parameter to the tracks of playlists, as well as artist views. To achieve this, specify a restrict parameter in your request that attempts to submit a clean substitution when available.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/albums?filter[equivalents]=1540031620&restrict=explicit\n\n\nNote\n\nWhen using the explicit restriction, this parameter replaces content with an explicit rating with the best available clean equivalent version.

    "html": "Overview\n\nSome GET requests support pagination of the objects or an object’s relationships and relationship views. Specify a limit parameter to restrict the number of resources returned. If you don’t supply a limit, the API supplies a default one. If you reach the limit to the number of resource objects in a response, the response contains a subset of the resource objects matching your criteria. In this case you must make more requests to get the rest of the objects.\n\nSee the corresponding resource’s object model for the default fetch limit. If there are more resource objects than permitted by the fetch limit, the response contains a next member whose value is a subpath to use in the next request. The subpath contains the offset parameter that specifies the next page. Similarly, a Relationship object may contain a next member that you can use to fetch more objects in a relationship.\n\nFor example, you may fetch all objects of a resource type, but specify the amount in the response by using the limit parameter.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/storefronts?limit=2\n\n\nIf there are more objects to fetch, the response contains a next member.\n\n{\n   \"data\":[\n      {\n          \"attributes\":{\n             \"defaultLanguageTag\":\"en-gb\",\n             \"name\":\"Anguilla\",\n             \"supportedLanguageTags\":[\n             \"en-gb\"\n             ]\n          },\n          \"href\":\"/v1/storefronts/ai\",\n          \"id\":\"ai\",\n          \"type\":\"storefronts\"\n      },\n      {\n          \"attributes\":{\n             \"defaultLanguageTag\":\"en-gb\",\n             \"name\":\"Antigua and Barbuda\",\n             \"supportedLanguageTags\":[\n             \"en-gb\"\n             ]\n          },\n          \"href\":\"/v1/storefronts/ag\",\n          \"id\":\"ag\",\n          \"type\":\"storefronts\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"next\":\"/v1/storefronts?offset=2\"\n}\n\n\nPass the next subpath, and optionally, use the limit parameter again, in the next request.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/storefronts?offset=2&limit=2\n\n\nContinue requesting the resource objects until the next member no longer appears in the response.\n\nSee Also\nEssentials\nGenerating Developer Tokens\nGenerate a developer token needed to make requests to Apple Music API.\nUser Authentication for MusicKit\nAuthenticate requests for user data using the Music User Token.\nHandling Requests and Responses\nWrite a request and handle responses from the API.\nHandling Resource Representation and Relationships\nFetch resources with extended attributes and included relationships and relationship views.\nStorefronts and Localization\nPick a region-specific geographic location from which to retrieve catalog information, or retrieve information from the user’s personal library.\nCommon Objects\nUnderstand the common JSON objects that framework responses contain.\nManaging Content Ratings, Alternate Versions, and Equivalencies\nHandle multiple and alternate versions of content."

    "title": "Handling Resource Representation and Relationships",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/handling_resource_representation_and_relationships",
    "html": "Overview\n\nResources are fetched with a default representation of attributes and relationships. Extend the default representation for a resource type to fetch additional attributes and include relationships and relationship views.\n\nNote\n\nIf any relationship or relationship view contains too many related resources, use pagination to fetch the next set of objects. See Fetching Resources by Page.\n\nExtend Resource Attributes\n\nThe server will fetch a subset of the available attributes for a resource type by default. The attributes not fetched by default are known as extended attributes. You may specify a set of attribute names using the extend query parameter to request these additional attributes for a resource type.\n\nFor example, when fetching an Albums resource, you can request that the server add the extended artistUrl attribute to the album’s other attributes:\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/albums/310730204?extend=artistUrl\n\n\nInclude Resource Relationships\n\nResponses contain some relationships and their related resources by default. Related resources in the response will be either resource objects with their attributes or resource identifiers without attributes. See how to include relationships in a single response below.\n\nFor example, these Album relationships have different default behaviors:\n\nThe tracks relationship includes the resource objects for the album’s songs and music videos, which are typically essential for working with albums.\n\nThe artists relationship only includes resource identifiers for the artist or artists associated with the album and excludes the attributes member in each resource object. This relationship allows you to link to an artist from an album, although some artist attributes are also attributes of the album.\n\nThe response doesn’t include all relationships with a resource by default. For example, the response omits the genres relationship, though you can expressly add this relationship to the request. This seldom-used relationship is often superseded by genreNames, which appear as an attribute of an album.\n\nUse the include parameter to specify a set of relationships to include with the resource in the response. The value of the include parameter is a comma-separated list of the relationship names to include. For relationships that include resource objects by default, there’s no need to specify them in the list; they’re included along with the specified relationships. For example, when fetching an Artists object, you can request the playlists objects using include.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/artists/462006?include=playlists\n\n\nYou may request the related resources without their attributes for one or more relationships using the relate parameter. This is a way to quickly retrieve identifiers to related resources to fetch later. Modifying the example above, you can request related playlists resource identifiers for inclusion when fetching an Artists object.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/artists/462006?relate=playlists\n\n\nInclude Resource Relationship Views\n\nThe response never includes relationship views with a resource by default. Use the views parameter to specify a set of relationship views to include with the resource in the response. The value of the views parameter is a comma-separated list of the relationship view names to include. For example, when fetching an Albums object, you can request the other-versions relationship view using views.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/albums/310730204?views=other-versions\n\n\nNote\n\nYou can request any combination of resource relationship and relationship views using the include, relate, and views parameters.\n\nScoping Parameters\n\nWhen not classified, the extend, relate, and include parameters apply to the primary resource collection of the response. For example, when fetching one or more artists, applying &include=music-videos adds the music-video relationship for the artists in the response’s primary data resource collection.\n\nThe extend, include, and relate parameters can be scoped to specifically target a resource type in the response. This applies to all resources in the response instead of just the primary resources. For example, if you wish to fetch a playlist, and would like to extend the artistUrl attribute on all songs resources in the response, you can extend the songs resource type specifically.\n\nhttps://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/playlists/pl.2b0e6e332fdf4b7a91164da3162127b5?extend[songs]=artistUrl\n\n\nIf you wish to fetch an artist, and would like to include the featured-albums relationship view along with the tracks for those albums, you can scope the include parameter to the albums resource type specifically.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/artists/462006?views=featured-albums&include[albums]=tracks\n\n\nFetch Resource Relationships Directly\n\nTo fetch a relationship exclusively, specify the name of the relationship after the id path parameter. For example, fetch just the tracks belonging to an album.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/albums/310730204/tracks\n\n\nBy default, the API fetches a limited number of related resources for the relationship. See the corresponding object model reference for the default fetch limits. To specify the number of objects fetched, use the limit parameter. For example, you can fetch an artist’s first five albums.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/artists/462006/albums?limit=5\n\n\nFetch Resource Relationship Views Directly\n\nTo fetch a relationship view exclusively, you must append the “/view/” followed by name of the view to the id path parameter. For example, fetch similar-artists for an identified artist.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/artists/462006/view/similar-artists\n\n\nWhen fetching a relationship view directly, you may request the associated attributes using the with parameter.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/artists/462006/view/similar-artists?with=attributes\n\n\nBy default, the API fetches a limited number of related resources for the relationship view. See the corresponding object model reference for the default fetch limits. To specify the number of objects fetched, use the limit parameter. For example, you can fetch the first three featured playlists for an artist.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/artists/462006/view/featured-playlists?limit=3\n\n\nSee Also\nEssentials\nGenerating Developer Tokens\nGenerate a developer token needed to make requests to Apple Music API.\nUser Authentication for MusicKit\nAuthenticate requests for user data using the Music User Token.\nHandling Requests and Responses\nWrite a request and handle responses from the API.\nStorefronts and Localization\nPick a region-specific geographic location from which to retrieve catalog information, or retrieve information from the user’s personal library.\nCommon Objects\nUnderstand the common JSON objects that framework responses contain.\nManaging Content Ratings, Alternate Versions, and Equivalencies\nHandle multiple and alternate versions of content.\nFetching Resources by Page\nUse pagination to fetch the next set of objects."

    "html": "Overview\n\nAfter adding the appropriate tokens to the header, compose your request to get data from the API and handle responses.\n\nCompose a Request\n\nApple Music API requests have common components. To compose a request, first specify the root path, https://api.music.apple.com/v1.\n\nFollow this part of the path with either /catalog or /me:\n\nThe /catalog path accesses the public Apple Music catalog.\n\nThe /me path accesses personalized content for the user such as their music library, ratings and listening history.\n\nFollow this path with any parameters that are specific to the endpoint. For example, to request information about a specific genre, construct a URL that includes the ID of the genre in the path.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/{storefront}/genres/{id}\n\n\nWhen requesting resources from the Apple Music catalog, you must include the storefront in the path. When requesting resources from the user’s personal library, replace the storefront information with the me string, as shown in the following example.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/ratings/albums/{id}\n\n\nEvery resource has a unique identifier in the Apple Music catalog. Resources in the user’s library have unique identifiers that are different than the Apple Music catalog identifiers. If a user removes an item from their music library but then adds it back later, it will have a new and different identifier.\n\nMost requests return only the requested resource. For information about how to request related resources at the same time, see Handling Resource Representation and Relationships.\n\nHandle a Response\n\nThere are three kinds of responses: Resource Collection, Results, and Errors.\n\nThe resource collections can come in multiple common forms which include:\n\nResource Collection (for example, https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/albums?ids=123,234)\n\nPaginated Resource Collection (for example, https://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/library-albums)\n\nRelationship Response (for example, https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/albums/123/tracks)\n\nRelationship View Response (for example, https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/albums/123/view/related-albums)\n\nFor results responses, there is always a top-level results member object that contains the information for the response. Results responses are always unique to the endpoint, such as charts or a search response.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/{storefront}/charts\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/{storefront}/search\n\n\nError responses contain an array of one or more error objects that indicate any issues while handling the request. The status code of the response reflects the primary error. See Error and HTTP Status Codes.\n\nDefault responses include:\n\nIf the request is for an existing single resource object, the status code is 200 (OK) and the data array contains the requested resource object.\n\nIf the request is for a single resource object that doesn’t exist, the status code is 404 (Not Found) and the response doesn’t contain a data array.\n\nIf the request is for multiple resource objects by ID, the status code is 200 (OK) and the data array includes the existing resource objects.\n\nIf the request is for multiple resource objects by ID and none of the resources exist, the status code is 200 (OK) and the data array is empty.\n\nA successful response for a resource collection with additional results contains a next link to the next page of fetched resources in the collection. See also Fetching Resources by Page.\n\nA successful response for a relationship request is 200 OK and the data array contains a paginated collection of resources contained in the relationship. A next link signifies that additional resources may be fetched from the relationship’s resource collection.\n\nA successful response for a relationship view request is 200 OK and the data array contains a paginated collection of resources contained in the view. The relationship view’s attributes are included when requested using the with parameter. A next link signifies that additional resources may be fetched.\n\nIf the request contains successfully modified or deleted resources, the status code is 204 (No Content) and the body is empty.\n\nIf you make a successful request to an endpoint that returns results, the status code is 200 (OK) and the response includes those results.\n\nIf the request isn’t accepted because its authorization is missing or invalid due to an issue with the developer token, the status code is 401 (Unauthorized). In this case, the response doesn’t contain a data array.\n\nIf the request isn’t accepted due to an issue with the media user token or because the request is using incorrect authentication, the status code is 403 (Forbidden). In this case, the response doesn’t contain a data array.\n\nIf the request isn’t supported as specified, the status code is 400 (Bad Request) and the errors array contains an error object for any identified problem.\n\nThe response status code is in the 500 range when errors are encountered on the server while processing the request.

    "html": "Overview\n\nTo make requests to the Apple Music API, you need to authorize yourself as a trusted developer and member of the Apple Developer Program. The header of every Apple Music API request requires a signed developer token.\n\nThere are two paths to generate developer tokens:\n\nIf you’re developing an app for Apple platforms (iOS, tvOS, watchOS or macOS), the recommended way to integrate with Apple Music is to use MusicKit for Swift, following the steps provided in Using Automatic Developer Token Generation for Apple Music API.\n\nFollow the directions below to create and manage developer tokens for other platforms.\n\nCreate a Developer Token\n\nA developer token is a signed token used to authenticate a developer in Apple Music requests. Creating a MusicKit identifier and private key allows you to use a developer token to authenticate yourself as a trusted developer and member of the Apple Developer Program.\n\nThe Apple Music API supports the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification, so you can pass statements and metadata called claims. For more information, see the JWT specification and the available libraries for generating signed JWTs.\n\nConstruct a developer token as a JSON object whose header contains:\n\nThe algorithm (alg) you use to sign the token, which should have a value of ES256\n\nA 10-character key identifier (kid) key, obtained from your developer account\n\nImportant\n\nApple Music supports only developer tokens signed with the ES256 algorithm. Apple Music rejects unsecured developer tokens or developer tokens signed with other algorithms. These rejections result in a 401 error code.\n\nIn the claims payload of the token, include:\n\nThe issuer (iss) registered claim key, whose value is your 10-character Team ID, obtained from your developer account\n\nThe issued at (iat) registered claim key, whose value indicates the time at which the token was generated, in terms of the number of seconds since epoch, in UTC\n\nThe expiration time (exp) registered claim key, whose value must not be greater than 15777000 (6 months in seconds) from the current Unix time on the server\n\nOptional, but recommended for web clients, use the origin claim (origin). Only use this JWT if the origin header of the request matches one of the values in the array. This addition helps prevent unauthorized use of the tokens. For example: \"origin\":[\"https://example.com\",\"https://music.example.com\"].\n\nTip\n\nTo locate your Team ID, sign in to your developer account, and click Membership in the sidebar. Your Team ID appears in the Membership Information section under the team name.\n\nA decoded developer token has the following format.\n\n{\n     \"alg\": \"ES256\",\n     \"kid\": \"ABC123DEFG\"\n}\n{\n     \"iss\": \"DEF123GHIJ\",\n     \"iat\": 1437179036,\n     \"exp\": 1493298100\n}\n\n\nAfter you create the token, sign it with your MusicKit private key using the ES256 algorithm.\n\nNote\n\nES256 is the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) name for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash.\n\nAuthorize Requests\n\nA developer token is used to authorize all Apple Music API requests. If you manage this directly, in all requests, pass the Authorization: Bearer header set to the developer token.\n\ncurl -v -H 'Authorization: Bearer [developer token]' \"https://api.music.apple.com/v1/test\"\n\n\nTo sign in and authenticate requests for an Apple Music subscriber, see User Authentication for MusicKit. For more information about requests, responses, and error handling, see Handling Requests and Responses.\n\nRequest Rate Limiting\n\nApple Music API limits the number of requests your app can make using a developer token within a specific period of time. If this limit is exceeded, you’ll temporarily receive 429 Too Many Requests error responses for requests that use the token. This error resolves itself shortly after the request rate has reduced.\n\nSee Also\nEssentials\nUser Authentication for MusicKit\nAuthenticate requests for user data using the Music User Token.\nHandling Requests and Responses\nWrite a request and handle responses from the API.\nHandling Resource Representation and Relationships\nFetch resources with extended attributes and included relationships and relationship views.\nStorefronts and Localization\nPick a region-specific geographic location from which to retrieve catalog information, or retrieve information from the user’s personal library.\nCommon Objects\nUnderstand the common JSON objects that framework responses contain.\nManaging Content Ratings, Alternate Versions, and Equivalencies\nHandle multiple and alternate versions of content.\nFetching Resources by Page\nUse pagination to fetch the next set of objects."

    "html": "Overview\n\nApple Music is a worldwide service that operates in many countries, regions, and languages. Content varies from one geographic region to another, so each request must contain a storefront object. Storefront defines the desired region and the supported languages for that region. For most requests, you specify the storefront associated with the current user, but you may also specify other storefronts as needed. For example, you might specify a storefront that better matches the user’s preferred language.\n\nEach storefront has a default language, and may support one or more additional languages. For example, the United States storefront includes American English as the default language, but also includes Mexican Spanish as an additional supported language. Apple Music automatically localizes responses using the storefront’s default language, but you can localize to a different language using the l query parameter. The value of that parameter must be one of the values in the supportedLanguageTags attribute of the storefront object. For example, the following request asks the US storefront to return an album in the Mexican Spanish (es-MX) localization.\n\nGET https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/albums/310730204?l=es-MX\n\n\nTopics\nRequesting a Catalog Storefront\nGet a Storefront\nFetch a single storefront by using its identifier.\nGet Multiple Storefronts\nFetch one or more storefronts by using their identifiers.\nGet All Storefronts\nFetch all the storefronts in alphabetical order.\nLocalization\nGet the best supported language for a storefront\nFetch the best supported language for a storefront from a list.\nHandling the Response\nobject Storefronts\nA resource object that represents a storefront, an Apple Music and iTunes Store territory that the content is available in.\nSee Also\nEssentials\nGenerating Developer Tokens\nGenerate a developer token needed to make requests to Apple Music API.\nUser Authentication for MusicKit\nAuthenticate requests for user data using the Music User Token.\nHandling Requests and Responses\nWrite a request and handle responses from the API.\nHandling Resource Representation and Relationships\nFetch resources with extended attributes and included relationships and relationship views.\nCommon Objects\nUnderstand the common JSON objects that framework responses contain.\nManaging Content Ratings, Alternate Versions, and Equivalencies\nHandle multiple and alternate versions of content.\nFetching Resources by Page\nUse pagination to fetch the next set of objects."

    "html": "Discussion\n\nThis parameter can be an event parameter or a dynamic parameter. A fixed value indicates that the haptic begins decreasing in intensity at the set time, where time 0 indicates now, or the current time.\n\nA dynamic value indicates that the start time of the decrease can change. For example, a value of 0 indicates that the decay time is at its default value. Positive values up to 1.0 increase the decay time exponentially, while negative values down to -1.0 decrease the decay time exponentially.\n\nHaptic intensity responds to this parameter. For example, the following graphic shows the intensity of a haptic pattern in gray. At the beginning, the haptic pattern's intensity increases from zero to its final value over a certain amount of time; this duration is called the attack. As the haptic pattern reaches its end, the intensity gradually transitions to zero over a certain amount of time; this duration is called the decay.\n\nSee Also\nHaptic Event Parameter IDs\nstatic let hapticIntensity: CHHapticEvent.ParameterID\nThe strength of a haptic event.\nstatic let hapticSharpness: CHHapticEvent.ParameterID\nThe feel of a haptic event.\nstatic let attackTime: CHHapticEvent.ParameterID\nThe time at which a haptic pattern’s intensity begins increasing.\nstatic let releaseTime: CHHapticEvent.ParameterID\nThe time at which to begin fading the haptic pattern.\nstatic let sustained: CHHapticEvent.ParameterID\nA Boolean value that indicates whether to sustain a haptic event for its specified duration."

    "title": "Preparing your app to play haptics | Apple Developer Documentation",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corehaptics/preparing_your_app_to_play_haptics",
    "html": "Overview\n\nThis article describes the process of setting up your app to play haptics. You'll check for device compatibility, create a haptic engine, and then configure the engine's handler properties.\n\nNote\n\nMake sure you set the engine's handler properties before starting it to play a haptic.\n\nCheck for device compatibility\n\nBefore you create and configure a haptic engine, check the hardware capabilities to see what type of feedback the device supports. Some devices don’t support haptic feedback, including iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Vision Pro. Checking the hardware capabilities lets you adjust your app’s behavior to provide alternative types of feedback as needed. For example, you might play stronger audio or multimedia, or you might provide visual feedback instead.\n\nThe following example fetches the hardware capabilities and checks the value of the supportsHaptics property to determine whether haptic feedback is available. The app then saves the result to a variable, which it uses later to determine what type of feedback to provide.\n\nvar supportsHaptics: Bool = false\n...\n// Check if the device supports haptics.\nlet hapticCapability = CHHapticEngine.capabilitiesForHardware()\nsupportsHaptics = hapticCapability.supportsHaptics\n\n\nFor an example of conditioning haptic playback, see Playing a Custom Haptic Pattern from a File.\n\nCreate a haptic engine\n\nThe CHHapticEngine is your app’s interface to the haptic device. Use an instance of a haptic engine to perform these key tasks:\n\n• Create players to play those haptic and audio patterns.\n\n• Play haptic patterns directly from a file URL.\n\n• Modulate haptic patterns during playback.\n\nCreate this engine early in your app’s life cycle—for example, in your main view controller’s viewDidLoad()—and store it in an instance variable or property so it doesn’t go out of scope during playback.\n\nvar engine: CHHapticEngine!\n...\n// Create and configure a haptic engine.\ndo {\n    engine = try CHHapticEngine()\n} catch let error {\n    fatalError(\"Engine Creation Error: \\(error)\")\n}\n\n\nNote\n\nThe haptic engine isn't a singleton; you can create multiple instances in different parts of your app or game, like different view controllers or levels. Each instance of the haptic engine behaves independently. Core Haptics is thread-safe, meaning you can execute player operations on separate threads.\n\nSet the reset handler to recover from failure\n\nCore Haptics calls the reset handler after the media server has recovered from failure. When this occurs, inside the reset handler, your app should do the following:\n\nRestart the haptic engine, if it was running at the time reset happened, by calling start().\n\nReregister any custom audio resources you had registered, using registerAudioResource(_:options:).\n\nRecreate all haptic pattern players you had created, using makePlayer(with:).\n\n// The reset handler provides an opportunity to restart the engine.\nengine.resetHandler = {\n    \n    print(\"Reset Handler: Restarting the engine.\")\n    \n    do {\n        // Try restarting the engine.\n        try self.engine.start()\n                \n        // Register any custom resources you had registered, using registerAudioResource.\n        // Recreate all haptic pattern players you had created, using createPlayer.\n\n\n    } catch {\n        fatalError(\"Failed to restart the engine: \\(error)\")\n    }\n}\n\n\nYour app could attempt to restart the engine inside the handler, allowing it to recover on its own. However, as shown in the code listing above, a restart may still fail if the external reason for the reset hasn't subsided.\n\nReceive notification of haptic engine stoppage due to outside causes\n\nWhen external factors cause the haptic engine to stop, like audio interruptions from a phone call or because the user has put your app in the background, Core Haptics calls the stoppedHandler. The reason for the stoppage is passed into the handler. Because stopping is a normal part of the life cycle, you need to restart the engine before it can play the next haptic.\n\nAs you're testing your app, set the stoppedHandler to debug the precise cause of the engine stoppage, as shown below.\n\n// The stopped handler alerts engine stoppage.\nengine.stoppedHandler = { reason in\n    print(\"Stop Handler: The engine stopped for reason: \\(reason.rawValue)\")\n    switch reason {\n    case .audioSessionInterrupt: print(\"Audio session interrupt\")\n    case .applicationSuspended: print(\"Application suspended\")\n    case .idleTimeout: print(\"Idle timeout\")\n    case .systemError: print(\"System error\")\n    @unknown default:\n        print(\"Unknown error\")\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn production, your app can handle each cause in a different way. For example, you could handle the case CHHapticEngine.StoppedReason.systemError by continuing the app without haptics, or by throwing a fatal error to terminate the app.\n\nNote\n\nThe stopped handler defined in the code above is called only when external causes trigger an engine stoppage. The stopped handler isn't called if you manually stop the engine through an explicit stop(completionHandler:) call. Instead, Core Haptics calls the completion handler passed as input to the explicit stop call.\n\nDefine and play haptics\n\nOnce you've set up your app to play haptics, you can incorporate haptic patterns. See:\n\nSimple haptic patterns defined inline as dictionaries: Playing a single-tap haptic pattern\n\nCustom file-based haptic patterns: Playing a Custom Haptic Pattern from a File\n\nProgrammatic haptics tied to real-time physics: Playing Collision-Based Haptic Patterns\n\nSee Also\nEssentials\nPlaying a single-tap haptic pattern\nCreate and play a transient haptic pattern from a dictionary literal inline.\nclass CHHapticEngine\nAn object that represents the connection to the haptic server.\nclass CHHapticPattern\nAn object representing a haptic waveform.\nprotocol CHHapticPatternPlayer\nA protocol that defines a standard pattern player capable of playing haptic patterns with fixed parameters.\nprotocol CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer\nA protocol that defines an advanced pattern player capable of looping, seeking, pausing, and resuming haptic playback."

    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corehaptics/playing_a_single-tap_haptic_pattern",
    "html": "Overview\n\nThis article describes how to define the haptic pattern for a single haptic tap and how to play that haptic pattern through a haptic engine.\n\nCreate a haptic engine\n\nThe CHHapticEngine is your app’s interface to the haptic device. An instance of a haptic engine allows you to create a CHHapticPatternPlayer or CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer to play individual haptics. Create the haptic engine as described in Preparing your app to play haptics.\n\nSpecify a dictionary literal\n\nThe next step is to create a dictionary literal representing the haptic. The following represents a single haptic tap:\n\nlet hapticDict = [\n    CHHapticPattern.Key.pattern: [\n        [CHHapticPattern.Key.event: [\n            CHHapticPattern.Key.eventType: CHHapticEvent.EventType.hapticTransient,\n            CHHapticPattern.Key.time: CHHapticTimeImmediate,\n            CHHapticPattern.Key.eventDuration: 1.0]\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\n\nEach entry in the dictionary shown above is a haptic event, with an event type, a start time, and a duration. In this case, the event type is hapticTransient because a single tap is a transient pattern — a quick impulse. The time is CHHapticTimeImmediate to indicate that the event begins immediately, right after time 0. The duration of 1.0 indicates that the event lasts one second.\n\nCreate a haptic pattern player from the dictionary\n\nInitialize a CHHapticPattern from the dictionary you just created.\n\nlet pattern = try CHHapticPattern(dictionary: hapticDict)\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to play your haptic, create a player for that pattern. Each player is responsible for playing one pattern. You can reuse a player to play its pattern as many times as you like.\n\nUse one of the haptic engine’s factory methods, like makePlayer(with:), to create the haptic pattern player.\n\nlet player = try engine.makePlayer(with: pattern)\n\n\nIf you call start(atTime:) on a player that’s already playing, it restarts itself at the beginning of the pattern.\n\nHaptic players are inexpensive, lightweight objects, so create and discard them freely. Unless your app requires real-time, latency-free haptic feedback in response to user interaction — like precise ticks on a dial — you can create your player right before playing the haptic.\n\nStart the engine and play the haptic pattern\n\nStart the haptic engine before you play a haptic player, and stop the engine once you’ve finished playing all haptic patterns. Play the haptic by calling the player’s start(atTime:) method.\n\n// Stop the engine after it completes the playback.\nengine.notifyWhenPlayersFinished { error in\n    return .stopEngine\n}\n\n\ntry engine.start()\ntry player.start(atTime: 0)\n\n\nIf the engine is in a running state when you call start(), the system plays the haptic at the scheduled time. Playback follows a “fire and forget” model, so your app doesn’t need to keep the player and pattern in memory once you’ve called start(). You need to retain your engine so it doesn’t exit scope during your program.\n\nUnless you’re playing several haptic patterns in succession, bookend haptic playback with starting and stopping the engine. Starting the engine ensures that the haptic engine is in a running state when you schedule a haptic to play. Stopping the engine after you finish playing the haptic conserves power and allows it to prepare for the next time your app needs haptic playback. Be aware that your engine may stop on its own in auto-shutdown mode.\n\nSee Also\nEssentials\nPreparing your app to play haptics\nSet up your app to play haptics.\nclass CHHapticEngine\nAn object that represents the connection to the haptic server.\nclass CHHapticPattern\nAn object representing a haptic waveform.\nprotocol CHHapticPatternPlayer\nA protocol that defines a standard pattern player capable of playing haptic patterns with fixed parameters.\nprotocol CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer\nA protocol that defines an advanced pattern player capable of looping, seeking, pausing, and resuming haptic playback."

    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corehaptics/representing_haptic_patterns_in_ahap_files",
    "html": "Overview\n\nAHAP is a JSON-like file format that specifies a haptic pattern through key-value pairs, analogous to a dictionary literal, except in a text file. You add an AHAP file to your Xcode project bundle like any other file resource, such as an audio file or an image.\n\nAn AHAP file doesn’t need an entry for every key. When Core Haptics loads an AHAP file, it sets missing entries to their default value and clamps out-of-range values to their minimum or maximum values, whichever is closer. The framework ignores unsupported keys. Indentation of nested levels is also not required; you don’t need to indent the various subdictionaries, but doing so helps you visually distinguish the levels. You can create these files in Xcode or another text editor, like TextEdit. For several example AHAP files and guidance for playing them, see Playing a Custom Haptic Pattern from a File.\n\nThis document lists the various keys and describes their effect on the resulting haptic pattern. Where applicable, this document also lists the default value for each parameter. The subsections cover keys at different levels of nesting, from top to bottom.\n\nDefine patterns at the top level\n\nThe only top-level keys are Pattern and Version. The value for Pattern is an array of subdictionaries. Each AHAP file can contain a single pattern. Version indicates the lowest version of Core Haptics that can support loading and playing the file. Later versions, indicated by a higher version number, may contain keys that aren’t supported in older versions of the framework.\n\nPattern\n\nArray of Event dictionaries representing a segment of the haptic to play.\n\nVersion\n\nThe Core Haptics version that supports the file.\n\nBuild a pattern from events\n\nEach pattern contains one or more events, defined by the Event key at the top level of the pattern dictionary. An event is a segment of the pattern with some duration and a set of properties, such as intensity or sharpness. Each event starts at its own time and can overlap other events.\n\nEvent\n\nDictionary of event type, start time, duration, and optional event parameters.\n\nYou can define two other keys in the pattern dictionary:\n\nParameter\n\nA key in the pattern dictionary that you use to define a dynamic parameter.\n\nParameterCurve\n\nA key in the pattern dictionary that you use to define a parameter curve.\n\nSee Add dynamic parameters to change the pattern during playback for more information on dynamic parameters, and Define parameter curves to automate dynamic parameter changes for more information on parameter curves.\n\nDefine events by their type, start time, and parameters\n\nEach pattern can have several events, which can overlap. For example, an AHAP file could describe a series of transient haptics that build in intensity, with each transient represented as an event. Likewise, an AHAP file that describes audio playing alongside the haptic could consist of an event of type AudioCustom along with an event of type HapticContinuous. Each event starts at a specific time, with its own specific parameters, like haptic intensity and sharpness for haptic events, or audio volume and pitch for audio events.\n\nEventType\n\nThe type of event described in the subdictionary, corresponding to its CHHapticEvent.EventType object. This string determines whether the pattern is a HapticTransient, HapticContinuous, AudioContinuous, or AudioCustom pattern.\n\nTime\n\nThe floating-point start time, relative to the beginning of the pattern.\n\nDuration\n\nThe floating-point duration of the pattern.\n\nEventParameters\n\nAn array of parameter dictionaries, each with ParameterID and Value.\n\nEventWaveformPath\n\nThe path string for the custom audio file, relative to the top of your bundle, such as MyAudioContent/Explosion.caf or its direct filename.\n\nEventWaveformPath is specific to audio events. When your app designates an audio file to play alongside a haptic, use an audio event with a waveform path and audio-specific properties:\n\nDefine an event parameter\n\nThe EventParameters key leads to an array of parameter subdictionaries. Each parameter describes one property of the event, like its haptic intensity or haptic sharpness. All parameters are optional. If you don’t include a parameter, the Core Haptics engine assumes its default value for that event.\n\nParameterID\n\nA CHHapticEvent.ParameterID string constant that indicates the type of parameter being defined.\n\nParameterValue\n\nThe numeric value of the associated parameter. These values are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to represent the minimum and maximum the system supports.\n\nSpecify the parameter by ID\n\nEach parameter has a ParameterID string and an associated value. The range of possible values may vary from parameter to parameter.\n\nHapticIntensity\n\nThe strength of the haptic event. The value is between 0 and 1.\n\nHapticSharpness\n\nThe degree to which the haptic event feels tingly, or persistent. The value is between 0 and 1.\n\nAttackTime\n\nThe amount of time it takes for the event’s intensity envelope to reach its full strength. The value is between 0 and 1.\n\nDecayTime\n\nThe amount of time it takes for the event’s intensity envelope to reach zero. The value is between 0 and 1. This applies only to events without sustained envelopes.\n\nReleaseTime\n\nThe amount of time it takes for a sustained intensity envelope to reach zero after the event finishes. The value is between 0 and 1.\n\nSustained\n\nA value of 1 to indicate a sustained intensity envelope, or 0 to indicate an unsustained intensity envelope.\n\nAudioBrightness\n\nThe high-frequency content of the sound. This value is between 0 and 1.\n\nAudioPan\n\nThe distribution of the audio signal. This value is between -1 and 1.\n\nAudioPitch\n\nThe pitch of the audio signal. This value is between -1 and 1.\n\nAudioVolume\n\nThe volume or loudness of the sound. This value is between 0 and 1.\n\nNote\n\nA value of 0 doesn’t mean that the parameter has no effect, or that the absolute value of the parameter is zero. It’s a normalized value that maps to the minimum value the system supports. Likewise, a value of 1 doesn’t indicate 1 second; rather, it maps to the maximum supported value.\n\nAdd dynamic parameters to change the pattern during playback\n\nLike event parameters, each dynamic parameter has a ParameterID string and an associated value. Unlike event parameters, dynamic parameters affect the entire pattern, across all events. You indicate a dynamic parameter in the AHAP file with an entry labeled Parameter at the same level as Event.\n\nHapticIntensityControl\n\nThe factor by which to modulate the intensity of the haptic. The value is between 0 and 1 and is applied multiplicatively.\n\nHapticSharpnessControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the sharpness of the haptic. The value is between -1 and 1. This dynamic parameter affects only continuous haptics and is applied additively.\n\nHapticAttackTimeControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the attack time of the haptic pattern’s events. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nHapticDecayTimeControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the decay time of the haptic pattern’s events. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nHapticReleaseTimeControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the release time of the haptic pattern’s events. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nAudioBrightnessControl\n\nThe factor by which to increase or decrease the audio brightness (high-frequency content) of the sound. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nAudioPanControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the audio signal’s pan. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nAudioPitchControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the audio signal’s pitch. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nAudioVolumeControl\n\nThe factor by which to modulate the volume of the sound. The value is between 0 and 1 and is applied multiplicatively.\n\nAudioAttackTimeControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the attack time of the audio pattern’s events. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nAudioDecayTimeControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the decay time of the audio pattern’s event. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nAudioReleaseTimeControl\n\nThe amount by which to increase or decrease the release time of the audio pattern’s event. The value is between -1 and 1 and is applied additively.\n\nDefine parameter curves to automate dynamic parameter changes\n\nLike dynamic parameters, parameter curves change the parameter values of the haptic pattern during its playback. Unlike with dynamic parameters, the changes are scheduled over time, and each value transitions to the next one linearly. You indicate a parameter curve in the AHAP file with an entry labeled ParameterCurve at the same level as Event. Parameter curves modify the same parameters as dynamic parameters modify, and they share all of the same ParameterID strings.\n\nParameterID\n\nA string constant that indicates the parameter that the curve changes.\n\nTime\n\nThe time at which to begin applying the parameter curve.\n\nParameterCurveControlPoints\n\nControl points that define the shape of the curve. Each point takes the form (time, value). Time is relative to the start of the curve.\n\nFor more information about parameter curves, see CHHapticParameterCurve.\n\nSee Also\nFile-based haptics\nPlaying a Custom Haptic Pattern from a File\nSample predesigned Apple Haptic Audio Pattern files, and learn how to play your own."

Simulator doesn’t support a haptic interface, so build and run this sample on an iPhone 8, 8 Plus, X, XR, XS, or XS Max running iOS 13 or later.\n\nConfigure the App to Play Haptics\n\nHapticSampler checks for device compatibility and sets up an instance of CHHapticEngine on launch.\n\n// Create and configure a haptic engine.\ndo {\n    // Associate the haptic engine with the default audio session\n    // to ensure the correct behavior when playing audio-based haptics.\n    let audioSession = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()\n    engine = try CHHapticEngine(audioSession: audioSession)\n} catch let error {\n    print(\"Engine Creation Error: \\(error)\")\n}\n\n\nSee Preparing your app to play haptics for more information about setting up the engine.\n\nStart the Haptic Engine\n\nAll AHAPs in the sample are included in the app bundle, so build a URL to the desired file by searching in the main bundle, as you might do for other included assets like audio files.\n\n// Express the path to the AHAP file before attempting to load it.\nguard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: filename, ofType: \"ahap\") else {\n    return\n}\n\n\nTap one of the buttons in the app to load the AHAP file associated with that button. Because the engine may not be started at that time, the app starts the engine as soon as a button is tapped.\n\n// Start the engine in case it's idle.\ntry engine?.start()\n\nPlay the AHAP\n\nAssuming the engine has started, call the engine’s method, playPattern(from:), passing it the URL to playing the file.\n\n// Tell the engine to play a pattern.\ntry engine?.playPattern(from: URL(fileURLWithPath: path))\n\n\nThis method of playback follows a fire and forget model; each haptic pattern plays until it reaches its end, then stops automatically.\n\nOnce the haptic starts playing, you can’t stop it, and pressing other buttons layers those haptics on top of any existing haptic patterns in the middle of playback. This layering allows you to combine a haptic pattern with a more continuous intent, like the rumble of thunder, with a more impulse-driven haptic pattern built from transient taps, like the strike of lightning.\n\nCore Haptics layers simultaneously playing haptics automatically. If you don’t want the layering, your app should wait out the duration of the first haptic before starting subsequent haptic players.\n\nNote\n\nHaptic patterns don’t blend like audio waveforms, and not all combinations produce a discernible effect. Playing two haptic events of the same type at the same time makes them hard to tell apart. Experiment with various combinations to ensure that the result feels right.\n\nCreate Advanced Pattern Players for More Granular Control\n\nTo have more granular control over individual haptics, such as configuring their pausing, resuming, and seeking behavior, create and maintain advanced pattern players using CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer instead of using playPattern(from:).\n\nadvancedPlayer = try hapticEngine.makeAdvancedPlayer(with: ahapPattern)\nadvancedPlayer.loopEnabled = true\n\nCompose Your Own Haptic\n\nTo compose your own haptic pattern, begin by modifying one of the AHAP files included in the project. You can copy components of it for producing a transient haptic pattern or a continuous haptic pattern, then build your own haptic by combining and modifying those pieces.\n\nAlternatively, you can write an AHAP file from scratch in a text editor, using the example AHAP files as a reference for proper nesting of event, pattern, and parameter dictionaries. For more information about the AHAP file format and the parameter keys that the format supports, see Representing Haptic Patterns in AHAP Files.\n\nSee Also\nFile-based haptics\nRepresenting haptic patterns in AHAP files\nUnderstand the Apple Haptic and Audio Pattern (AHAP) file format."

The sample app shows how to vary the volume of the synthesized audio signal and the intensity of the transient haptic pattern based on the sphere’s velocity during impact.\n\nAlthough the sample app uses UIKit Dynamics and UIKit for simplicity and familiarity with UIKit classes, but your app can also use a 2D engine like SpriteKit to represent interactive object collisions.\n\nNote\n\nHapticBounce requires Xcode 11 or later. Simulator doesn’t support a haptic interface, so build and run this sample on an iPhone 8, 8 Plus, X, XR, XS, or XS Max running iOS 13 or later.\n\nConfigure the App to Play Haptics\n\nCheck for device compatibility and set up an instance of CHHapticEngine, as the sample demonstrates when you launch the app.\n\n// Create and configure a haptic engine.\ndo {\n    engine = try CHHapticEngine()\n} catch let error {\n    fatalError(\"Engine Creation Error: \\(error)\")\n}\n\n\nSee Preparing your app to play haptics for more information about setting up the engine.\n\nDefine the Objects in UIKit Dynamics\n\nExpress the walls as boundaries in a UICollisionBehavior with the sphere.\n\nwallCollisions = UICollisionBehavior(items: [sphereView])\nwallCollisions.collisionDelegate = self\n\n\n// Express walls using vertices.\nlet upperLeft = CGPoint(x: -1, y: -1)\nlet upperRight = CGPoint(x: windowWidth + 1, y: -1)\nlet lowerRight = CGPoint(x: windowWidth + 1, y: windowHeight + 1)\nlet lowerLeft = CGPoint(x: -1, y: windowHeight + 1)\n\n\n// Each wall is a straight line shifted one pixel offscreen, to give an impression of existing at the boundary.\n\n\n// Left edge of the screen:\nwallCollisions.addBoundary(withIdentifier: NSString(\"leftWall\"),\n                           from: upperLeft,\n                           to: lowerLeft)\n\n\n// Right edge of the screen:\nwallCollisions.addBoundary(withIdentifier: NSString(\"rightWall\"),\n                           from: upperRight,\n                           to: lowerRight)\n\n\n// Top edge of the screen:\nwallCollisions.addBoundary(withIdentifier: NSString(\"topWall\"),\n                           from: upperLeft,\n                           to: upperRight)\n\n\n// Bottom edge of the screen:\nwallCollisions.addBoundary(withIdentifier: NSString(\"bottomWall\"),\n                           from: lowerRight,\n                           to: lowerLeft)\n\n\nEach bounce against the wall is a dynamic item behavior, which lets you tweak the elasticity to match the haptic effect. An animator of class UIDynamicBehavior ties together all of these dynamic objects with gravity.\n\nanimator = UIDynamicAnimator(referenceView: view)\n\n\n// Add bounce, gravity, and collision behavior.\nanimator.addBehavior(bounce)\nanimator.addBehavior(gravity)\nanimator.addBehavior(wallCollisions)\n\n\nHapticBounce uses the device’s accelerometer to move the sphere.

ViewController implements this delegate, UICollisionBehaviorDelegate, to respond to collisions.\n\nTo vary the haptic at the point of collision, check the sphere’s velocity and map it to a normalized (0 to 1) intensity and sharpness value, as follows:\n\n// Map the bounce velocity to intensity & sharpness.\nlet velocity = bounce.linearVelocity(for: item)\nlet xVelocity = Float(velocity.x)\nlet yVelocity = Float(velocity.y)\n\n\n// Normalize magnitude to map one number to haptic parameters:\nlet magnitude = sqrtf(xVelocity * xVelocity + yVelocity * yVelocity)\nlet normalizedMagnitude = min(max(Float(magnitude) / kMaxVelocity, 0.0), 1.0)\n\n\n// Create a haptic pattern player from normalized magnitude.\nlet hapticPlayer = try playerForMagnitude(normalizedMagnitude)\n\n\nThe sample sets kMaxVelocity based on experimentation dropping the sphere from a maximum possible height, but you can adjust the value to create a stronger or weaker intensity pattern.\n\nOn each impact, you can create a haptic player, an inexpensive operation, on the spot, using the desired haptic parameters.\n\nlet pattern = try CHHapticPattern(events: [audioEvent, hapticEvent], parameters: [])\nreturn try engine.makePlayer(with: pattern)\n\n\nStarting the player plays the haptic.\n\n// Start player, fire and forget\ntry hapticPlayer?.start(atTime: CHHapticTimeImmediate)\n\nSynthesize Audio to Play With the Haptic\n\nIn addition to playing haptic patterns, the haptic engine also synthesizes audio. The engine in HapticBounce plays this audio by adding an audio event to the same haptic player as the haptic event, as follows:\n\nlet volume = linearInterpolation(alpha: magnitude, min: 0.1, max: 0.4)\nlet decay: Float = linearInterpolation(alpha: magnitude, min: 0.0, max: 0.1)\nlet audioEvent = CHHapticEvent(eventType: .audioContinuous, parameters: [\n    CHHapticEventParameter(parameterID: .audioPitch, value: -0.15),\n    CHHapticEventParameter(parameterID: .audioVolume, value: volume),\n    CHHapticEventParameter(parameterID: .decayTime, value: decay),\n    CHHapticEventParameter(parameterID: .sustained, value: 0)\n], relativeTime: 0)\n\n\nInstead of adjusting haptic intensity and sharpness based on the sphere’s velocity, you vary audio volume and pitch.\n\nSee Also\nProgrammatic haptics\nDelivering Rich App Experiences with Haptics\nEnhance your app’s experience by incorporating haptic and sound feedback into key interactive moments.\nUpdating Continuous and Transient Haptic Parameters in Real Time\nGenerate continuous and transient haptic patterns in response to user touch.\nclass CHHapticEvent\nAn object that describes a single haptic or audio event.\nclass CHHapticEventParameter\nA static parameter value that represents a single property of the haptic pattern.\nclass CHHapticDynamicParameter\nA value that you send to a haptic pattern player to alter a property value during playback.\nclass CHHapticParameterCurve\nA curve that you send to a haptic pattern player to alter a property value gradually during playback."

This key marks the beginning of an array of events and parameterID definitions. Each event has an associated time that indicates when the system delivers the event to the haptic engine.\n\nThese key-value pairs represent not only events constituting the pattern, but also individual parameters of each event, which are characteristics of the haptic, such as sharpness and intensity. More complicated patterns also contain key-value pairs for parameter curves, which you can use to modulate parameters over time.\n\nHaptic Patterns\n\nTo add haptics to your app, you create an instance of CHHapticEngine, load a pattern, and use the engine to create a player to play that pattern. You create a pattern in one of three ways:\n\nDictionaries. Each entry in the dictionary defines a single characteristic of the haptic, like its intensity, start time, or duration. See Playing a single-tap haptic pattern to learn more about creating a dictionary inline.\n\nArrays of events and parameters. The CHHapticEvent class represents a haptic event as an object in code. The key-value pairs in a dictionary correspond to the properties and parameters associated with a CHHapticEvent. Haptic event objects are just another representation of the haptics dictionary.\n\nAHAP files. This JSON-compliant file format specifies a haptic pattern through key-value pairs, analogous to a dictionary literal, except in a text file. Add this file to your Xcode project bundle.\n\nYou can produce the same kind of content with all forms of pattern creation.\n\nHaptic Intensity and Sharpness\n\nRegardless of the building block you choose to generate a custom haptic, you can control its intensity and sharpness. Intensity varies the haptic’s amplitude or strength. Sharpness lets you determine the character of the haptic experience.

The advanced player allows your app to dynamically change haptic characteristics such as intensity and sharpness through dynamic parameters and parameter curves, capabilities not found in the standard player.\n\nTopics\nStarting and Stopping Playback\nfunc start(atTime: TimeInterval)\nStarts playing the pattern at the specified time.\n\nRequired\n\nfunc stop(atTime: TimeInterval)\nStops playing the pattern at the specified time.\n\nRequired\n\nfunc cancel()\nStops the pattern player immediately and returns the specified error.\n\nRequired\n\nSending Parameters to a Haptic\nfunc sendParameters([CHHapticDynamicParameter], atTime: TimeInterval)\nSends an array of haptic parameters, starting at the specified time.\n\nRequired\n\nfunc scheduleParameterCurve(CHHapticParameterCurve, atTime: TimeInterval)\nSchedules a parameter curve to begin transitioning a parameter at a certain time.\n\nRequired\n\nSilencing Haptic Playback\nvar isMuted: Bool\nA Boolean that silences all haptic and audio output from the player when set to true.\n\nRequired\n\nRelationships\nInherits From\nNSObjectProtocol\nInherited By\nCHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer\nSee Also\nEssentials\nPreparing your app to play haptics\nSet up your app to play haptics.\nPlaying a single-tap haptic pattern\nCreate and play a transient haptic pattern from a dictionary literal inline.\nclass CHHapticEngine\nAn object that represents the connection to the haptic server.\nclass CHHapticPattern\nAn object representing a haptic waveform.\nprotocol CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer\nA protocol that defines an advanced pattern player capable of looping, seeking, pausing, and resuming haptic playback."

    "html": "Overview\n\nCore Haptics lets you add customized haptic and audio feedback to your app. Use haptics to engage users physically, with tactile and audio feedback that gets attention and reinforces actions. Some system-provided interface elements—like pickers, switches, and sliders—automatically provide haptic feedback as users interact with them. With Core Haptics, you extend this functionality by composing and combining haptics beyond the default patterns.\n\nYour app can play custom haptic patterns crafted from basic building blocks called haptic events (CHHapticEvent). Events can be transient, like the feedback you get from toggling a switch, or continuous, like the vibration or sound from a ringtone. You can use transient and continuous patterns independently, or build your pattern from precise combinations of the two. Another type of haptic event allows you to play customized audio content as part of your pattern.\n\nTopics\nEssentials\nPreparing your app to play haptics\nSet up your app to play haptics.\nPlaying a single-tap haptic pattern\nCreate and play a transient haptic pattern from a dictionary literal inline.\nclass CHHapticEngine\nAn object that represents the connection to the haptic server.\nclass CHHapticPattern\nAn object representing a haptic waveform.\nprotocol CHHapticPatternPlayer\nA protocol that defines a standard pattern player capable of playing haptic patterns with fixed parameters.\nprotocol CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer\nA protocol that defines an advanced pattern player capable of looping, seeking, pausing, and resuming haptic playback.\nProgrammatic haptics\nYou can synthesize haptics by configuring parameters like haptic intensity and sharpness. Event parameters define the initial state, while dynamic parameters change the pattern during playback.\nDelivering Rich App Experiences with Haptics\nEnhance your app’s experience by incorporating haptic and sound feedback into key interactive moments.\nPlaying Collision-Based Haptic Patterns\nPlay a custom haptic pattern whose strength depends on an object’s collision speed.\nUpdating Continuous and Transient Haptic Parameters in Real Time\nGenerate continuous and transient haptic patterns in response to user touch.\nclass CHHapticEvent\nAn object that describes a single haptic or audio event.\nclass CHHapticEventParameter\nA static parameter value that represents a single property of the haptic pattern.\nclass CHHapticDynamicParameter\nA value that you send to a haptic pattern player to alter a property value during playback.\nclass CHHapticParameterCurve\nA curve that you send to a haptic pattern player to alter a property value gradually during playback.\nFile-based haptics\nApple Haptic and Audio Pattern (AHAP) files are a JSON-like representation of synced haptics and audio that you can load and play from disk.\nPlaying a Custom Haptic Pattern from a File\nSample predesigned Apple Haptic Audio Pattern files, and learn how to play your own.\nRepresenting haptic patterns in AHAP files\nUnderstand the Apple Haptic and Audio Pattern (AHAP) file format.\nGame controller haptics\nPlaying Haptics on Game Controllers\nAdd haptic feedback to supported game controllers by using Core Haptics.\nHaptic errors\nlet CoreHapticsErrorDomain: String\nA string representation of the haptic error domain.\nstruct CHHapticError\nA structure that represents a framework error."

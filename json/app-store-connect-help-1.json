    "html": "Manage app information\nOverview of export compliance\n\nIf your app uses, accesses, contains, implements, or incorporates encryption, and you intend to upload, test, and distribute your app, you’ll need to determine your export compliance requirements in App Store Connect.\n\nExamples of apps requiring an export compliance determination include, but aren’t limited to, apps that use:\n\nStandard encryption algorithms.\n\nCrypto functionality within Apple’s operating system.\n\nProprietary or non-standard encryption algorithms. The U.S. Government defines \"non-standard cryptography\" as any implementation of “cryptography” involving the incorporation or use of proprietary or unpublished cryptographic functionality, including encryption algorithms or protocols that have not been adopted or approved by a duly recognized international standards body (e.g., IEEE, IETF, ISO, ITU, ETSI, 3GPP, TIA, and GSMA) and have not otherwise been published.\n\nPlease note that it’s your responsibility to review the Export Administration Regulation to determine if your app’s use of encryption requires a formal classification (Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System or CCATS) from BIS. All liabilities associated with misinterpretation of export regulations or claiming exemption inaccurately are your responsibility. To learn about encryption export controls, search for “encryption policy” on the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) website. The import and export of encryption apps distributed in France are also controlled by the Government of France. The main items of control for France are Secure Storage, Secure Communications, and Security Anti-Virus applications. Exemptions include Banking and Medical applications. For more information about these French controls, visit the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI) website.\n\nWhen you submit a new version of your app, you’ll need to answer questions in App Store Connect about your app's use of encryption. Follow the steps below before submitting your app to App Review to ensure that you’re submitting the right documentation and to bypass these questions if your app doesn’t use encryption.\n\nDetermine your export compliance requirements\n\nApp Store Connect provides a simple way for you to determine your export compliance requirements by presenting you with a set of questions about your app and where you plan to make it available. Complete the following next steps based on the results of your answers:\n\nScenario\n\nNext Steps\n\nNo export compliance documentation required\n\nUpdate your app’s information property list (Info.plist) file in Xcode so that you don’t need to answer encryption questions with each app submission.\n\nExport compliance documentation required\n\nUse App Store Connect to submit your app encryption documentation.\nOnce the documentation is approved, attach it to your beta build or app version build.\nUpdate your app’s information property list (Info.plist) file in Xcode so that you don’t need to answer encryption questions with each app submission."

Hold the pointer over a region name to reveal all App Store countries or regions included in that region.\n\nUnits Sold\n\nThis is the total number of units sold in the corresponding region. Note that this value only includes purchases.\n\nBalance*\n\nThis consists of any amounts not paid out from previous months, or amounts returned.\n\nEarned\n\nThis displays the gross earnings amount per region for that fiscal period.\n\nTotal*\n\nThis displays the total earnings per region, including both the previous months and the current month's balances.\n\nTaxes and Adjustments\n\nThis displays the net of all input taxes, adjustments, or withholding taxes for that region. Hold the pointer over the amount to view a breakdown of all taxes and adjustments included in the net total presented.\n\nWithholding Tax. Withholding tax represents amounts withheld by Apple and remitted to taxing authorities in accordance with government requirements specific to the country or region. Withholding taxes can vary based on your location, the completion of any optional tax forms and the tax treaties entered into by your country or region. Visit Tax forms overview for more information.\n\nInput Taxes. Input taxes are amounts added to your payment to meet your tax requirements in certain countries or regions. For example, Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies if you are based in Australia on the basis you are registered for GST.\n\nTotal Owed\n\nThis is the sum of Earned and Taxes and Adjustments and displays the estimated amount owed to you in the currency of each reported region and revenue type. If there is a carry forward balance, this is the sum of Total, and Taxes and Adjustments.\n\nExchange Rate\n\nThis is the exchange rate at the time of payment, used to calculate total proceeds in your bank account currency. The exchange rate is only displayed if the payment for the report month selected has been disbursed.\n\nPer Schedule 2 to your Developer Agreement, our bank converts payment amounts into the currency of your bank account. The exchange rate is established by our bank and, due to Apple’s volume, is generally a more favorable rate than used by your local bank. The rates are typically the spot rate on the date of payment and no more than three business days prior to the date the proceeds are received into your account.\n\nProceeds or Total Estimated Proceeds\n\nThe name of this column will vary depending on whether or not a payment has been executed for the report month selected.\n\nTotal Estimated Proceeds. This is displayed if payment to you has not yet been made. This is the estimated amount of proceeds that will be dispersed in your bank account currency.\n\nIf iTunes does not have an exchange rate for a particular currency, you will see the amount converted to USD by default. This is for display purposes only, and payment will be made in your chosen bank account currency.\n\nProceeds. This is displayed if payment has been transferred to your bank account. This is the actual amount of proceeds paid for the corresponding region and report period. Values are displayed in your bank account currency.\n\nPayment Date\n\nThe payment date displayed in Payments and Financial Reports is the date the payment leaves Apple’s bank.\n\n* Balance and Total columns will only be displayed if there is a running balance from the previous payment period."

    "html": "Reference\nPerformance metrics\nRates and ratios\n\nTerm\n\nDescription\n\nRetention rate\n\nRetention measures the usage of your app over time starting from the first installation or re-download on the App Store.\n\nDaily Retention = Active Devices on day X of the retention period/Active Devices during the entire retention period.\n\nFor example, if your app was first downloaded by customers on 100 devices on May 1, and seven days later (on May 8) 20 devices are still active with at least one session, the retention rate on May 8 is 20% (or 20 active devices out of 100).\n\nConversion rate\n\nCalculated by dividing the number of downloads and pre-orders on the App Store by unique device impressions. When a user pre-orders an app, it counts toward your conversion rate. It's not counted again when it downloads to their device.\n\nFor example, if your app is viewed on the App Store on 100 devices, and 50 users download it, and 20 users pre-order it, your conversion rate for the selected period would be 70%.\n\nProduct page conversion rate\n\nThe number of downloads and pre-orders that came from your app’s App Store product page divided by unique product page views. When a user pre-orders an app, it counts toward your conversion rate. It's not counted again when it downloads to their device. number of First-Time Downloads, Redownloads, and Pre-Orders that came from your app’s product page by Unique Product Page Views. Pre-Orders are counted on the day the pre-order is initiated and, to avoid double counting, the subsequent download is excluded.\n\nFor example, if your product page is viewed on 100 devices, and 50 users download the app, and 20 users pre-order it, your conversion rate for the selected period would be 70%.\n\nSales per paying user\n\nYour app’s total sales (including associated in-app purchases) / your app’s total number of paying users on the App Store for the selected period.\n\nFor example, if your app’s total sales for the period is $100, and your app has 100 paying users, your sales per paying user is $1.\n\nSessions per active device\n\nThe number of times your app was opened by an App Store customer for at least two seconds / the number of active devices for your app in the selected period.\n\nFor example, if your app was opened 100 times, and you have 10 active devices for the same period, then your Sessions Per Active Device ratio is 10.\n\nProceeds per paying user\n\nThe estimated amount you'll receive for sales of your apps or in-app purchases / your app’s total number of paying users on the App Store for the selected period.\n\nFor example, if your app’s total proceeds for the period are $100, and your app has 100 paying users, your proceeds per paying user are $1.\n\nCrash rate\n\nA metric available for peer group benchmark that shows the number of crashes per session for the selected period.\n\nFor example, if your app had 10 crashes and 100 sessions for the selected period, the crash rate is 10%."

    "html": "Reference\nIn-app purchase information\nGeneral Information\n\nThe main in-app purchase properties identify the product in App Store Connect and in the app.\n\nProperty\n\nDescription\n\nApple ID\n\nA unique identifier automatically generated for your in-app purchase when you add the in-app purchase to your account.\n\nNote: This identifier isn't the same as your Apple ID that you use to sign in to App Store Connect and your developer account.\n\nReference Name\n\nA unique name you give to your in-app purchase for internal tracking that's not visible to customers, but used in App Store Connect and Sales and Trends reports. The reference name can include any characters and can be as long as 64 characters.\n\nThe reference name can be edited at any time without review.\n\nProduct ID\n\nA unique ID specific to your app that you can assign to your in-app purchases to uniquely identify them within your app.\n\nThe product ID can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscores, and can be as long as 100 characters. You need separate identifiers for in-app purchases in your iOS apps and your macOS apps.\n\nWhen your app uses StoreKit to communicate with the App Store, it uses product IDs to retrieve the configuration data you provided for each in-app purchase. When a user wants to make a purchase, your app identifies the in-app purchase using its product ID.\n\nThe product ID isn't editable after you save the in-app purchase.\n\nOnce a product ID is assigned to an in-app puchase, it can't be reused for another in-app purchase within the same app, even if you delete the original in-app purchase with that ID.\n\nReview Notes\n\nAdditional information about the in-app purchase that might help Apple review the submission, such as test user accounts and passwords. Review notes should not exceed 4000 characters.\n\nPromotional Image\n\nA promotional image is required if you want to promote your in-app purchase on your App Store product page. This image will represent your in-app purchase in all countries or regions where your app is available for devices running iOS 11 or later. If you’re also using offer codes for auto-renewable subscriptions, your promotional image will appear on the App Store page when customers redeem their codes on iOS 14 or later. You can submit up to 20 in-app purchases, with their respective promotional images, for review at a time. Your promotional image must meet the following requirements:\n\nJPG or PNG.\n\nDimensions of 1024 x 1024 pixels.\n\n72 dpi, RGB, flattened and no rounded corners.\n\nShow to all App Store users, even those who don’t have the app installed\n\nAn indication that you would like all customers to see your promoted in-app purchases, which is based on the user device information. By default, this is selected. If you deselect the checkbox, but haven’t implemented the SKProductStorePromotionController API, your in-app purchase will not be visible on the App Store. Visit Promote in-app purchases to relevant customers only. Note that a customer needs to have opened your app on their device at least once to see your order and visibility settings inside your app.\n\nApp Review Screenshot\n\nA screenshot of the in-app purchase that clearly shows the item or service being offered. This screenshot is used for review only and isn't displayed on the App Store.\n\nUpload a screenshot that meets any of the screenshot specifications your app supports. Once you’ve uploaded a screenshot, you can update it but not remove it.\n\nLocalizable information\n\nAdd localizable in-app purchases information used in the product display. You must include these properties for at least one language. For a list of languages, visit App Store localizations.\n\nChanges to the localized information require review. The existing text displays on the store until the new text is approved. The change has its own status separate from the overall status of the in-app purchase. Before your changes are reviewed, you can revert the change.\n\nProperty\n\nDescription\n\nDisplay Name\n\nThe name of the in-app purchase that is displayed to customers. The display name must be at least two characters and no more than 30 characters.\n\nDescription\n\nA description of the in-app purchase that potentially displays to users. If you make your in-app purchase available for promotion, this displays under your in-app purchase name on the App Store. The description must be no more than 45 characters."

    "html": "Reference\nAuto-renewable subscription information\n\nProperty\n\nDescription\n\nSubscription Group\n\nA set of subscription products with varying levels and durations. Users can subscribe to one subscription product per group at a time.\n\nSubscription Group Reference Name\n\nAn internal name you choose for a subscription group. This name will only appear on App Store Connect and in Sales and Trends reports, and won’t be visible to users.\n\nSubscription Group Display Name\n\nA user-facing name you choose for a subscription group. This is the name that appears on the App Store, and it can be localized. Subscription group display names must not contain control characters (for example, null, new lines, carriage returns, escape, and other invisible characters), or markup language (for example, HTML tags, or Unicode characters, such as emoticons, diacritics, or special characters).\n\nApp Name Display Options\n\nA set of options that let you choose between using your app’s name or providing a custom name to display above the Subscription Group Display Name on the Manage Subscriptions page on user devices.\n\nAuto-Renewable Subscription\n\nA product that allows users to purchase dynamic content for a set period. This type of subscription renews automatically unless cancelled by the user. Subscription duration and price is configured in App Store Connect.\n\nAuto-Renewable Subscription Levels\n\nA ranking system of subscriptions within a subscription group that determines the upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade path available to subscribers. Levels make it possible to offer varying access (basic, premium) of the same service. If you offer only one subscription product in your app, the subscription defaults to a single level within the subscription group.\n\nIf you have multiple subscription products, arrange them in order from the one that offers the most (level 1) to the one that offers the least. You can stack subscriptions with equal content but different durations and other similar variables at the same level. Each level can have multiple subscription products, allowing for multiple durations and prices for people to choose from. This lets them upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade within the subscription group without impacting their days of paid service.\n\nUpgrade\n\nWhen someone switches to a subscription that you’ve ranked at a higher level. The customer’s prorated payment from lower level subscription is refunded to the original payment method. They’re charged for the higher level subscription, which goes into effect immediately. The date of upgrade is the renewal date for the higher level subscription.\n\nDowngrade\n\nWhen someone switches to a subscription that you’ve ranked at a lower level. They’re charged for the lower level subscription on their next renewal date.\n\nCrossgrade\n\nWhen someone switches between subscriptions that you’ve ranked at the same level. If the subscriptions are different durations, the crossgrade goes into effect on the customer’s next renewal date. If the subscriptions are the same duration, the customer’s prorated payment from the previous subscription is refunded to the original payment method. Then they’re charged for the new subscription, which goes into effect immediately. The date of cross grade is the renewal date for the new subscription.\n\nAuto-Renewable Subscription Duration\n\nThe length of time before the subscription renews and the subscriber is charged. Possible durations are 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The duration can’t be changed after you submit for review.\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions renew on the same day as the calendar date of the original purchase. If a one month free trial starts on January 7, the trial ends on February 7. If a one-month duration starts on a date that doesn’t occur in the next month, the trial ends on the last day of the next month, and reverts to the original date the next time that date occurs. For example, if someone subscribes on January 30, the next renewal date is February 28 (or February 29 in a leap year), and then March 30.\n\nAuto-Renewable Subscription Display Name\n\nA user-facing name you choose for a subscription. This is the name that appears on the App Store, and it can be localized. Subscription display names must not contain control characters (for example, null, new lines, carriage returns, escape, and other invisible characters), or markup language (for example, HTML tags, or Unicode characters, such as emoticons, diacritics, or special characters).\n\nRelated\nIn-app purchase types\nIn-app purchase information"

    "html": "Reference\nApp Store pricing and availability start times by country or region\n\nWhen you make certain changes to your app, the dates and times those changes go into effect on the App Store will vary based on the country or region. This includes changes such as, setting the availability of apps, in-app purchases, and pre-orders, scheduling introductory and promotional offers, or adjusting prices.\n\nTimes marked with an asterisk reflect the time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) minus 1 day from the scheduled date in App Store Connect. For example: A price change is scheduled in App Store Connect for January 1. In Afghanistan, the price change goes into effect December 31 at either 6:00 p.m. (UTC) or 7:00 p.m. (UTC), depending on whether the U.S. is observing daylight saving time.\n\nIf you schedule a price change in App Store Connect for a date and time in UTC that has already passed in some countries or regions, your changes go into effect immediately but may take up to 24 hours to appear to all users.\n\nThe times in the table below represent the UTC time when the U.S. isn’t observing daylight saving time. Daylight savings time in the U.S. generally starts on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. During U.S. daylight savings time, the UTC time is one hour earlier.\n\nISO code\n\nCountry or region\n\nUTC time when changes go into effect\n\nAFG\n\nAfghanistan\n\n7:00

    "html": "Reference\nProvide app motion information\n\nApp motion is a required app information property for all visionOS apps on the App Store. This information will display on your app’s product page on the App Store to inform users who may be sensitive to apps with high motion.\n\nThere are two possible values for this property:\n\nValue\n\nDefinition\n\nYes, this app contains high motion\n\nHas frequent fast or sudden camera movements, quick turns, or unusual orientations.\n\nNo, this app doesn't contain high motion\n\nDoesn't have frequent fast or sudden camera movements, quick turns, or unusual orientations.\n\nAbout app motion\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro, the user’s viewpoint acts as a virtual camera and moves with the motion of their head and body. In some experiences, the virtual camera moves without the user moving their head or body (either controlled by the user through hand gestures or input devices, or scripted by the app without user input).\n\nWhen to choose “No, this app doesn’t contain high motion”\n\nIf the virtual camera in your app doesn’t move without the user moving their head or body, choose “No, this app doesn’t contain high motion.” You won't need to assess your app further.\n\nWhen to assess your app for high motion\n\nIf the virtual camera in your app moves without the user moving their head or body, you might need to choose “Yes, this app contains high motion.” To find out, follow the guidance below to assess your app experience for:\n\nFast forward or backward motion\n\nUnusual orientations\n\nFast rotation speeds\n\nUnexpected motion\n\nKeep the following in mind:\n\nAssess only the motion of the user’s viewpoint as a virtual camera, not the motion of a user-controlled character or vehicle. This distinction is especially important when the motion of the virtual camera is different than the motion of a controlled character or vehicle.\n\nIf your app has multiple configuration options that affect the motion experience, use the default configuration to assess the experience.\n\nRate the average motion in your app. If there’s only a brief moment of high motion at a few points in your app and the rest contains no motion, you don’t need to indicate high motion in your app.\n\nIf your app consists of several different first-party experiences that are intended by design to be part of the core app experience, consider the average motion across all of them and whether the average contains high motion.\n\nApps that host a variety of third-party content (like user-uploaded videos or HTML5 games) shouldn’t have a high motion label, unless the app’s intent is to have lots of content with high motion (like user uploads of their first-person thrill-seeking experiences).\n\nElements to assess\nFast forward or backward motion\n\nCombinations of forward or backward virtual camera motion can lead to very high pixel speeds.\n\nExample 1 demonstrates the pixel speed when the camera moves forward quickly, with objects close by, resulting in high motion. The red arrows indicate the objects’ pixel speed in the scene.\n\nExample 2 shows a much slower pixel speed that doesn’t fall under the category of high motion. This can be produced by moving objects farther away or with slower camera motion.\n\nChoose “Yes, this app contains high motion” if the combination of forward or backward virtual camera speed and object distance in your app produces a pixel speed similar to or higher than that shown in Example 1.\n\nExample 1: High pixel speed\n\nExample 2: Low pixel speed\n\nUnusual orientations\n\nWhen the horizon of the virtual world does not match the real world, users may experience discomfort. This situation can occur when the virtual camera is rolled left or right around its longitudinal axis, or pitched up or down.\n\nChoose “Yes, this app contains high motion” if the virtual camera rolls around its longitudinal axis or pitches up or down more than 10 degrees, with less than 5 minutes between each instance. This includes loops, steep banks or slopes, and upside-down motion.\n\nFast rotation speeds\n\nUsers can also experience discomfort when they experience fast camera rotation speeds around their vertical axis (yaw).\n\nChoose “Yes, this app contains high motion” if the virtual camera yaws left or right smoothly, while simultaneously moving forward or backward at speeds equal to or slower than running. This includes user-controlled and scripted smooth camera turns in first-person-view experiences.\n\nUnexpected motion\n\nChoose “Yes, this app contains high motion” if the virtual camera makes unexpected and/or unpredictable motions with less than 5 minutes between each instance. This includes falls, turns, spins, and other orientation changes."

    "html": "Reference\nApp bundle information\n\nApp bundle information refers to the set of properties required to create an app bundle. Some information is specific to the app bundle, some is derived from the first app you add to the app bundle (called the primary app), and other information is derived from all of the apps in the bundle.\n\nBundle-specific information\n\nThis information is required for the primary language of the app bundle. Additional localizations are optional.\n\nProperty\n\nDescription\n\nApp bundle name\n\nThe name of the app bundle as it appears on the App Store.\n\nApp bundle description\n\nThe descriptions of the app bundle as it appears on the App Store.\n\nMarketing URL\n\nThis is optional. This can be the same URL as you use for the individual apps or a different one.\n\nPrice\n\nThe level that determines both the customer price and your proceeds.\n\nThe price tiers are broken down to Compatible Price Tiers and Incompatible Price Tiers. Compatible Price Tiers represent the price tiers that have met the minimum and maximum bundle pricing rules listed in App Bundle Availability and Price. Selecting one of these tiers can ensure that your app bundle can be made available on the App Store as long as all other requirements have been met.\n\nNote that future price changes and intervals that have been set for your app could affect the list of compatible price tiers.\n\nSKU\n\nA unique ID for your bundle. The bundle SKU must be different from that of the SKU of the individual apps. You can use letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscore. The SKU can't start with a hyphen, period, or underscore.\n\nCleared for Sale\n\nSelect Cleared for Sale to make your app bundle available on the App Store. There are no bundle-specific country or region settings. An app bundle will be live on the App Store only where all the member apps are available.\n\nFor example, if some of the apps in the bundle are cleared for sale worldwide but some are live only in specific countries or regions, the bundle will be available only in those countries or regions. You won't be able to select the Cleared for Sale checkbox if you already have ten app bundles cleared for sale. If you wish to clear a new app bundle for sale, you must first remove the Cleared for Sale check box from a different live bundle.\n\nPrimary app information\n\nThis information is derived from the first app you add to a bundle. You don’t need to provide this information separately for the app bundle.\n\nProperty\n\nDescription\n\nCategory\n\nThe app bundle category will be derived from the primary app’s category.\n\nPrimary language\n\nThe primary localization is the primary language of the first app in the bundle.\n\nUpon the initial creation of your app bundle, the bundle’s primary language will default to that of the primary app in the bundle. If another app is rearranged into the first position in the list of apps, it'll become the primary app, but the primary language won’t change.\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nThe privacy policy of your primary app will be used for the app bundle’s privacy policy.\n\nLicense Agreement\n\nIf your primary app has a custom license agreement, it'll be used for the app bundle’s privacy policy.\n\nCopyright\n\nThe app bundle copyright information will be derived from the primary app’s category.\n\nTrade Representative Contact Information\n\nIf your primary app has a trade representative contact information, it'll be used for the app bundle’s privacy policy.\n\nBundle set information\n\nThis information is derived from the set of apps in the bundle. You don’t need to provide this information separately for the app bundle.\n\nProperty\n\nDescription\n\nIcon\n\nThe bundle icon consists of the icons for the first four apps in the bundle.\n\nScreenshots\n\nApp bundles can display a maximum of ten screenshots, with an equal number of screenshots represented for each app. For example, if your app bundle contains five apps and each app has five screenshots, only two screenshots from each app will be displayed for your app bundle.\n\nThe order of the screenshots is based on the order of the apps in the bundle. The screenshots can be rearranged only as the apps in the bundle are rearranged.\n\nApp previews\n\nApps that have an app preview will always display it in place of the first screenshot.\n\nRatings\n\nThe rating is determined by the highest rating among the apps in the bundle. For example: if the bundle consists of an app with a 12+ rating and an app with a 9+ rating, the app bundle will have a rating of 12+.\n\nAvailable localizations\n\nLocalizations will be derived from the common localizations across all of the apps.\n\nKeywords\n\nEach key word associated with the individual apps in the app bundle will be associated with the bundle. This isn't displayed on the bundle page in App Store Connect\n\nMade for Kids\n\nIn order for an app bundle to be listed in the Made for Kids section on the App Store, all the apps in the bundle need to have the same age band.\n\nRelated\nEdit app bundle information\nCreate and submit app bundles\nPlatform version information"

    "html": "Distributing apps in the European Union\nChoosing terms for your apps in the European Union\n\nApple offers an Alternative Terms Addendum for developers distributing apps in the European Union (EU), which allows them to distribute apps outside the App Store. For developers who want nothing to change for them — from how the App Store works currently and in the rest of the world — no action is needed, and they can continue to distribute their apps only on the App Store and use its private and secure In-App Purchase system. For those who adopt the new terms, the fees you may owe to Apple may change. Access the available data and tools to help you determine how these terms may apply to your business if you choose to adopt them, including a fee calculator, new App Install reports, and the Sales and Trends dashboard.\n\nThis information is provided for estimation purposes only.\n\nTo understand potential fees if you choose the new business terms, you can use your app’s historical performance to estimate future fees. You'll need:\n\nThe number of first annual installs your app generated in 2023, which is available in the new App Install Reports in Sales and Trends. Fees won’t be charged against installs in these reports.\n\nNote: Installs from Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager aren't included in these reports, but will be included in future reports under the new business terms.\n\nIf you offer in-app purchases: Your app’s 2023 sales from iPhone and iPad devices in the EU, available in the Sales and Trends dashboard.\n\nDownload Historical App Install Reports for 2023\n\nRequired role: Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales with Reports. View role permissions.\n\nHistorical App Install Reports for 2023 are available for download through App Store Connect on the web and the App Store Connect API. To get started using the API, generate an API Key, assign user permissions, and learn how to download Sales and Trends Reports.\n\nThere are two versions of the reports available. Version 1_0 reports first annual installs from iPhone devices only. Version 1_1 includes first annual installs from both iPhone and iPad devices.\n\nTo download them through App Store Connect on the web:\n\nFrom the App Store Connect homepage, click Sales and Trends.\n\nOn the left, choose Sales and Trends Reports.\n\nGo to the Historical App Install Reports section.\n\nChoose a vendor.\n\nSelect Historical App Install Reports.\n\nClick Download.\n\nUnzip the compressed GZIP (.gz) files by opening them or using a utility.\n\nEstimate your Core Technology Fee\n\nOpen the extracted Install_Summary_By_Install_Type text file in a spreadsheet application.\n\nHeaders at the top of the report indicate your developer name, the region (European Union), and the reporting year (Jan – Dec 2023).\n\nData appears for the number of first annual installs generated by each app in your developer account, including the number of first annual installs above the threshold, the total number of first annual installs for each app, and a breakdown of first annual installs by install type.\n\nChoose an app, and copy the number of first annual installs for that app from column E and paste it into the fee calculator.\n\nExample: Sample report highlighting the data in column E, which you can use help you estimate potential fees for any app in your account.\n\nEstimate your 2023 sales on iPhone and iPad devices in the EU\n\nIf you sell digital goods and services in your app, you can input your 2023 sales data from Sales and Trends into the fee calculator to understand how your commission may change under the new fee model if you have similar levels of sales as you had in 2023.\n\nFrom the App Store Connect homepage, click Sales and Trends.\n\nOn the left, choose Sales.\n\nIn the date picker, select “Year” and “2023”.\n\nSelect “Add Filters”, “Device”, “iPhone”, and \"iPad\".\n\nSelect \"Add Filters\", \"Territory\". Under \"My Groups\", select \"European Union\".\n\nSelect “Add Filters”, “Parent App”, and enter the name or Apple ID of the app you want to evaluate.\n\nA rounded sales value appears at the top of the dashboard. For a more exact value, click the export button on the top right of the chart and choose your preferred export option.\n\nIf you have exported your data from the chart, open the file in your preferred spreadsheet program and scroll all the way to the right to view your total sales on iPhone and iPad in the European Union for 2023.\n\nSubtract any taxes applicable to your sales from this number. Consult your tax advisor if you have any questions.\n\nInput the resulting number into the fee calculator.\n\nUse the Historical App Install Reports from 2023 to help you understand how you may accumulate first annual installs in the European Union if you choose to adopt the new business terms. The reports cover the full 2023 calendar year; apps launched in 2024 won’t see any data in these reports.\n\nReport Name\n\nNotes\n\nInstall Summary Report by Territory\n\nView this report to learn how different territories may drive different numbers of first annual installs for your apps.\n\nInstall Summary Report by Install Type\n\nView this report to learn how install types, such as first-time installs, reinstalls, and updates, may contribute to your first annual install count.\n\nInstall Summary Report by Channel\n\nView this report to understand your first annual installs by install channel. In this report, the only two possible values are App Store and TestFlight. In the future, if you distribute your apps on other app marketplaces, those channels will appear as additional channel values.\n\nInstall Detailed Report\n\nUse this report to find out in which months your historical first annual installs occurred. For apps with an existing user base prior to 2023, many of the first annual installs occur in the month when the app's first update occurred.

    "html": "Distributing apps in the European Union\nCommissions, fees, and taxes\n\nIf you adopt the new business terms for apps distributed in the European Union (EU), you may need to pay the following commissions and/or fees to Apple when you distribute your app through the App Store. Commission rates and fees apply to all prices payable by each user minus any transaction taxes charged by the app.\n\nIn jurisdictions where government-imposed taxes—such as digital services taxes, etc. are levied, an additional fee is charged.\n\nLearn more about making payments to Apple for the Core Technology Fee and alternative payment commissions.\n\nTerm\n\nDefinition\n\niOS\n\niPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and/or watchOS\n\nCommission\n\nFor paid apps, in-app purchases of digital goods or services, and/or linking out to purchase digital goods and services on your website, the following rates apply.\n\n17%\n\n27%\n\nIf you're enrolled in the App Store Small Business Program or renew a qualifying auto-renewal subscription beyond one year, the following reduced commission rates apply.\n\n10%\n\n12%\n\nIf you're enrolled in the Apple Video Partner Program or News Partner Program, the following reduced commission rates apply. The App Store payment processing fee of 3% also applies.\n\n10%\n\n12%\n\nPayment processing fee\n\nWhen using the App Store payment processing and related commerce services for in-app purchases, the following fees apply. This fee also applies to all paid apps.\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\nIf you use an alternative PSP within your app or link users to your website to process payments, payment processing fees to Apple do not apply.\n\nNo fee\n\nNo fee\n\nCore Technology Fee\n\nFor iOS apps distributed on the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or an alternative app marketplace that reach significant scale, you’ll pay for each first annual install over 1 million first annual installs. For more details, view documentation.\n\n€0.50\n\nNo fee\n\nAlternative payment commissions\n\nIf you support either alternative payment processing or link out to your webpage, you’re responsible for paying a commission to Apple on the sale of digital goods and services in the EU. Payment processing fees to Apple do not apply.\n\nFor linking out, the commission applies to sales of digital goods or services that are initiated within seven calendar days after the user taps “Continue” on the in‑app notice sheet. This includes any adjustments for refunds, reversals and chargebacks.\n\nFor auto-renewable subscriptions that occur pursuant to use of linking out, a transaction is classified as, (i) a sale initiated, including with a free trial or offer, within seven calendar days after a link out; and (ii) each subsequent renewal after the subscription is initiated.\n\nInvoices for alternative payment commissions\n\nIf you owe fees or commissions (for transactions outside of the App Store payment processing and related commerce services) in a given month, you’ll receive an invoice by the 15th day of the following month and will need to provide payment to Apple within 30 days of receiving the invoice. You can pay directly from your bank using a unique, virtual routing number for your developer account that’s provided on the invoice. Please note that late payments accrue interest and nonpayment may result in the offset of App Store In-App Purchase proceeds owed to you, removal of the app from the App Store, or removal from the Apple Developer Program.\n\nLearn more about updating your account for invoicing requirements.\n\nTaxes\n\nAs is standard for business transactions, commissions and fees, don’t include taxes. There may be applicable taxes, as required by tax law, added as new lines on your invoice. Taxes may apply in certain countries and/or regions, including but not limited to, value-added tax (VAT), sales and use tax, sales and service tax (SST), goods and services tax (GST), and consumption tax, etc. Generally, the applicability of tax depends on a combination of factors:\n\nYour business location (your legal entity address provided when enrolling in the Apple Developer Program).\n\nTax information that you provide to Apple (such as valid tax ID, exemption status, etc.).\n\nThe billing Apple legal entity.\n\nIn the event that any amount payable by you to Apple for commissions and fees is subject to any applicable withholding tax, and that you’re required to collect and remit such tax, you shall gross up the relevant payment to Apple, so that after you deduct and remit the applicable withholding tax to tax authority, Apple shall receive the same amount as originally invoiced. You shall bear full responsibility for such compliance obligations. If you apply any applicable withholding tax, please properly indicate on any withholding tax documentation the correct Apple legal entity issuing the specific invoice and provide Apple with tax remittance documentation.\n\nFor details, view the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU. If you have questions, consult your tax adviser.\n\nTax on alternative payment transactions\n\nFor in-app purchases made using alternative payment processing or link out to your webpage, you're responsible for taxes, including (but not limited to):\n\nDetermining if a transaction is taxable;\n\nCharging and collecting the taxes at the applicable rate;\n\nRemitting the taxes to the appropriate taxing authority;\n\nProviding any required documentation to the users or appropriate taxing authority; and\n\nMeeting all other country-specific tax compliance obligations imposed as a result of making in-app sales subject to tax in the storefront country and/or your country of residence.\n\nPrior to using alternative payment processing or link out on an EU storefront, you must provide Apple with an EU specific VAT ID that demonstrates you're registered to handle VAT payments. Only one EU VAT ID is necessary for all EU storefronts.\n\nRequired tax forms\n\nSome countries require a business status to be part of the program; therefore, if you're located within these countries you're required to provide tax information by completing your tax form in App Store Connect to prove that you can be treated as a business-to-business customer. Once you’ve provided the required information, it will be reviewed and we will reach out to you if we’re unable to verify it.

    "html": "Configure Game Center\nAdd an app to a group\n\nAfter you create a group, you can add other apps to the group. The purpose of adding an app is to share leaderboard and achievement data. When you add an app with existing Game Center assets to a group, you decide which of the app’s leaderboards and achievements are retained as part of the group.\n\nIf an app has existing leaderboards and achievements, you must decide whether to add or merge the app’s components with those in the group. Added leaderboards and achievements are defined in the group as they were in the app prior to being grouped. Merging your leaderboards and achievements will replace the version in the app with the one you choose from the group. App Store Connect simplifies this process by presenting only compatible assets and available options at each step. The options that App Store Connect presents to you are dependent on your app and group data. Types of assets (for example, leaderboard sets) that the app doesn’t have won't display.\n\nImportant: If the group uses leaderboard sets, the app you add to the group must use leaderboard sets. Learn how to configure leaderboard sets. Additionally, apps can only belong to one Game Center group. If you wish to add your app to a new group, it must be removed from any existing groups.\n\nGuidelines for Moving Leaderboards\n\nThe choices available when merging leaderboards depend on the type of leaderboard, its property values, and your previous selections. The guidelines for merging leaderboards are:\n\nLeaderboards can only merge with a compatible leaderboard. Leaderboards are compatible if the values of the score format type and sort order properties are the same.\n\nLeaderboards must be moved in the order App Store Connect presents them.\n\nA combined leaderboard can only merge with a combined leaderboard. If a compatible combined leaderboard isn’t available, it must be added to the group instead of merged.\n\nAn attached leaderboard can merge with an attached leaderboard only if their combined (parent) leaderboards are also being merged with each other.\n\nAn attached leaderboard can merge with a classic leaderboard. The classic leaderboard is attached to the corresponding group combined leaderboard.\n\nA classic leaderboard can merge with a classic leaderboard.\n\nA classic leaderboard can merge with an attached leaderboard.\n\nAfter merging two leaderboards, all of the group’s leaderboard property values remain the same with the exception of these properties:\n\nScore Range: If the app’s score range is larger than the group’s score range, the group’s score range expands to include the app’s score range. For example, if the range of the app’s leaderboard is 1–500 and the range of the group’s leaderboard is 1–250, the range of the group’s leaderboard is set to 1–500.\n\nLanguages: When merging a leaderboard that has more languages than a group, the additional leaderboard languages will be automatically applied to the merged leaderboard. For example, if a grouped leaderboard supports English and the leaderboard being merged supports English and French, the French language will be copied over to the merged leaderboard.\n\nGuidelines for Moving Achievements\n\nThere are no restrictions for adding achievements to a group; however, the following remain true:\n\nThe maximum number of points for each achievement is 100.\n\nThe total maximum number of points for a single app's achievements is 1000.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the total points for all group achievements.\n\nAfter the merge, all of the group’s achievement property values remain the same with the exception of the languages, which follow this rule:\n\nWhen merging an achievement that has more languages than a group, the additional achievement languages will be automatically applied to the merged achievement. For example, if a grouped achievement supports English and the achievement being merged supports English and French, the French language will be copied over to the merged achievement.\n\nRequired role: Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Developer, or Marketing.

You must choose to add or merge your existing leaderboards and achievements.\n\nNote: Your existing leaderboard and achievement IDs are listed with a “grp.” prefix. Leaderboards and achievements that aren't merged can keep the same ID or be assigned a new one; however, the “grp.” prefix must be included when merging to a group.\n\nAdd an app’s leaderboard to the leaderboards already defined for the group.

The purpose of adding an app to a Game Center group is to share data, specifically to share leaderboards and achievements. When you add an app with existing Game Center assets to a group, you decide which of the app’s leaderboards and achievements are retained as part of the group. App Store Connect guides you through this process by presenting only compatible assets and options at each step.\n\nYou can define leaderboards and achievements for a group in two ways:\n\nDefine leaderboards and achievements for an individual app; then, when you move the app to a group, you specify how the app leaderboards and achievements are merged with the group leaderboards and achievements.\n\nAdd an app to a group that already has leaderboards and achievements defined. The app uses the existing group leaderboards and achievements. Like apps, groups can organize leaderboards into sets. If a group uses leaderboard sets, apps you add to the group either already use leaderboard sets or can’t have any leaderboards defined.\n\nWhile an app can only belong to one group, there’s no restriction on the type of apps that can belong to a group. For example, you can create a group containing iOS and macOS apps that share the same leaderboards and achievements. There’s no limit to the number of groups per account or to the number of apps that can belong to a group.\n\nWhen you’re ready to release a version of an app that’s part of a group, you determine which of the group leaderboards and achievements go live with the app. In addition, you set the app’s multiplayer compatibility options to include the other apps from the group.

However, you can schedule a price increase later.\n\nIncrease the price of an auto-renewable subscription\n\nIncreases in auto-renewable subscription prices result in either a notice to active subscribers or a request for consent, based on certain criteria below. Subscribers on introductory or promotional price subscriptions, including free trials and paid offers, will renew for at least one more billing period at the price that was displayed when they subscribed, to ensure their notice or request for consent for the new price is sent at least 30 days in advance. If a subscriber doesn’t consent before the first renewal at the higher price, their subscription will expire at the end of the last billing cycle at the former price.\n\nConsent needed\n\nIf any of the following applies, subscribers must consent to the price increase before their next renewal date in order for the subscription to renew. * Apple will automatically contact subscribers by email or push notification to request consent.\n\n* If you increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription in India, subscribers who have enabled UPI AutoPay must consent to the new price and have a sufficient payment balance associated with their Apple Account, or they’ll go into the billing retry state at the end of their current billing period. Apple will notify these subscribers as part of the price increase notice, but you may also wish to notify subscribers separately. Subscribers who don’t have a sufficient Apple Account balance or who wish to continue paying with UPI AutoPay must repurchase the subscription at the new price. Learn more.\n\nThe subscriber is located in a region that requires consent for any price changes.\n\nThe price increase is more than 50% of the current price and the difference in price exceeds approximately US$5 per period for non-annual subscriptions, or US$50 per year for annual subscriptions. (International equivalents for prices not in USD are based on current exchange rates with specific thresholds that are subject to change based on changes in taxes or foreign exchange rates.) View a list of thresholds per storefront.\n\nThe subscriber experienced a price increase for that subscription within the past 12 months.\n\nThe timing of price consent requests from Apple depends on the length of the subscription. If a price increase occurs within the minimum required notice period (7 days for weekly subscriptions, 27 days for 1 month subscriptions, and 30 days for subscription durations longer than 1 month), subscribers will renew at their existing price for one more billing period and will be notified before the end of their next billing period.\n\nSubscription duration\n\nFirst email notification (email, push, in-app messaging)\n\n2 month, 3 month, and 6 month, and annual subscriptions\n\n60 days before renewal date\n\nMonthly subscriptions\n\n29 days before renewal date\n\nWeekly subscriptions\n\n7 days before renewal date\n\nIf a subscriber doesn’t agree to the new price or takes no action, Apple will continue to request consent approximately weekly through email, push notifications, and in-app messaging until their subscription expires at the end of their current billing cycle. Learn about displaying in-app consent messaging with StoreKit.\n\nConsent not needed\n\nIf none of the criteria apply, Apple will automatically notify subscribers of the price increase with no additional request for consent. Notifications are sent via email and push notifications if enabled by the subscriber 30 or 7 days before the next renewal date. On iOS 13.4 or later, Apple will also notify subscribers via in-app messaging. If a price increase occurs within the minimum required notice period, subscribers will renew at their existing price for one more billing period and will be notified before the end of their next billing period.\n\nFirst email\n\nFirst in-app messaging\n\nPush notification\n\n30 days before renewal date.\n\nNote: Weekly subscriptions renew at the increased price on the fourth consecutive renewal.\n\nFirst app launch after entering notice period.\n\n7 days before renewal date, if in-app messaging wasn't viewed.\n\nNote: Price changes only apply to active subscribers. If a subscription is recovered in the billing retry or grace period state, it will renew at the existing price for one more billing period. 30 days before the renewal date, the subscriber receives notice of the price change, and the subscription renews at the next renewal date at the new price. Subscribers won't receive a notification if the subscription isn't going to renew.\n\nTo schedule a price increase:\n\nFrom Apps, select your app.\n\nIn the sidebar, click Subscriptions.\n\nClick an auto-renewable subscription, go to the Subscription Prices section, and click the add button (+).\n\nClick Plan Subscription Price Change, then select the countries or regions where you want to edit pricing.\n\nChoose a start date, country or region, and price, then click Next. To search from a larger list of 800 price points, click See Additional Prices.\n\nApp Store Connect will determine the soonest your price change can be scheduled for based on timezones for your desired date (generally 1 to 2 days in advance.)

App Store Connect will provide an indication if consent is required (or if they'll simply be notified) for each country or region. If you have customer groups that have had their prices preserved and your change is scheduled for the future, keep in mind that circumstances may change and consent will be required based on the conditions of the customer at the time of the increase. You are responsible for ensuring you understand when consent will be required.\n\nClick Next.\n\nView the list of planned price changes.\n\nIf all of the information is correct, click Confirm.\n\nOnce a price increase goes into effect, it can’t be reversed.\n\nUn-preserve prices for subscribers\n\nFrom Apps, select your app.\n\nIn the sidebar, click Subscriptions.\n\nClick the subscription group name.\n\nClick the subscription reference name.\n\nScroll down to the Subscription Pricing section and click View all Subscription Pricing.\n\nClick Starting Price.\n\nClick Edit Price.\n\nApp Store Connect displays the countries or regions where subscribers currently pay a lower price\n\nSelect the countries or regions where you want to increase the price.

Click Export as CSV.\n\nTo cancel a scheduled price change, move your pointer over the right side of the price change row until the delete button (—) appears. Click the delete button.\n\nNote: In certain cases, such as upcoming tax or foreign exchange rate adjustments, or when a manually adjusted price is starting or reverting, you may not be able to remove an upcoming price change.\n\nIn the dialog that appears, click Delete.\n\nClick the date to view the set or planned price. If you’ve previously preserved pricing for existing subscribers, the current prices paid by these subscribers and the start date of the prices will also appear.\n\nHow will changes to foreign exchange rates and tax adjustments affect auto-renewable subscription pricing?\n\nApple will not make price adjustments on your auto-renewable subscription products. Retail price changes initiated by Apple due to tax changes and significant foreign exchange rate movements will exclude auto-renewable subscriptions. For any value-added tax (VAT) rate changes, your proceeds and Apple’s commission will be calculated after the deduction of VAT, which means that your proceeds will change. You can choose to pass any changes caused by taxation or foreign exchange onto your subscribers by adjusting the price for your subscription."

    "html": "Manage subscriptions\nOffer auto-renewable subscriptions\n\nApp Store Connect offers tools to help you run a subscription business on the App Store. How you configure your subscriptions in App Store Connect determine how users subscribe to your service, how often they are billed, and how they upgrade and downgrade between offerings. To begin offering a subscription in your app, you will need to create a Subscription Group, then add one or more Subscription products to that group, then assign levels to those products. Subscription setup is structured as the following:\n\nSubscription group: A set of subscription products with varying levels and durations. Users can subscribe to one subscription product per group at a time.\n\nSubscription: A product that lets users purchase dynamic content for a set period. Auto-renewable subscriptions renew automatically, unless cancelled by the user. Subscription duration and price is configured in App Store Connect.\n\nSubscription levels: A ranking system of subscriptions within a subscription group that determines the upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade path available to subscribers. Levels make it possible to offer varying access (basic, premium) of the same service.\n\nSubscription duration: The length of time before the subscription renews and the subscriber is charged. Possible durations are 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.\n\nSingle subscription product setup\n\nIf you offer only one subscription product in your app, the subscription defaults to a single level within the subscription group.\n\nMultiple subscription and durations product setup\n\nArrange your subscriptions in order from the one that offers the most (level 1) to the one that offers the least. You can stack subscriptions with equal content but different durations and other similar variables, at the same level. Each level can have multiple subscription products, allowing for multiple durations and prices for people to choose from. This lets them upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade within the subscription group without impacting their days of paid service.\n\nSubscription proceeds rate\n\nDuring a subscriber’s first year of service, you receive 70% of the subscription price at each billing cycle, minus applicable taxes. After a subscriber accumulates one year of paid service in the same subscription group, your net revenue increases to 85% of the subscription price, minus applicable taxes. Time spent within a subscription offer is also counted toward the total. Members of the App Store Small Business Program receive 85% starting on the first day.\n\nWhen an auto-renewable subscription expires, the days of paid service stop accumulating. If someone resubscribes or the subscription is recovered within 60 days, the days of paid service continue from the recovery date. Conversely, if the subscription is recovered after 60 days, the rate reverts to 70% and the day count starts over.\n\nWhen a subscription expires due to a billing issue, Apple attempts to renew the subscription and collect payment. If you enabled the billing grace period for your apps, there won’t be any interruption to days of paid service or to your revenue, if Apple is able to recover the subscription within the billing grace period (either 6 or 16 days, depending on the subscription duration). Learn more about billing grace periods.\n\nYou can find information about subscription performance, subscriber activity, and proceeds in your Sales and Trends reports. Learn more.\n\nNote: It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.\n\nRequired role: Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Developer, or Marketing. View role permissions.\n\nCreate a subscription group\n\nTo offer subscriptions within your app, you must first create a subscription group in App Store Connect. When you create subscription products, you'll be able to add these products to the subscriptions group. Before creating subscriptions, ensure that you understand the right subscription setup for your business model. Learn about offering subscriptions.\n\nIn the sidebar under Monetization, click Subscriptions.\n\nClick the add button (+).\n\nEnter a reference name.\n\nClick Create\n\nCreate an additional subscription group\n\nIf you want to offer groups of subscriptions with varying subscription levels, you’ll need to create more than one subscription group.\n\nNote: Since users can only buy one subscription within a group at a time, creating a single group is the best practice for most apps, as it prevents people from accidentally purchasing multiple subscriptions. Users who buy subscriptions in multiple groups are billed separately for each subscription.\n\nIn the sidebar under Monetization, click Subscriptions.\n\nClick the add button (+).\n\nRead and acknowledge the warning by selecting the checkbox and clicking Next.\n\nNote: You’ll only be prompted with a warning when creating your second subscription group.\n\nEnter the reference name for the new group.\n\nClick Create.\n\nAdd subscription products\n\nIn the Sidebar under Monetization, click Subscriptions.\n\nClick a subscription group name.\n\nClick Create.\n\nNote: If you're adding a subscription to a group that already has existing subscriptions, you'll click the add button (+).\n\nEnter the subscription’s reference name and Product ID, then click Create. Once you've created your subscription product, you'll be taken to its information page to add more details.\n\nUnder Subscription Duration, choose a duration and click Save.\n\nUnder Subscription Prices, set a price.\n\nUnder Review Information, provide any additional information that may help the App Review team review your in-app purchase.\n\nOptionally, enable Family Sharing, edit the subscription’s tax category, and add localizations.\n\nClick Save.\n\nNote: If you'd like your subscription to be accessible from more than one app, create an equivalent subscription product for each app. Learn how to offer subscriptions across multiple apps.\n\nAssign subscription levels\n\nAfter you've created a subscription product, you can add subscription group information and set subscription levels, which will determine the upgrades, downgrades, and crossgrades available within a group.\n\nYou don’t have to assign multiple levels. You can choose to offer a single subscription product or offer multiple subscription products and assign them all to the same level within a group. Learn about setting up subscription groups and ensure that you understand the right level setup for your business model.\n\nFrom Apps, select your app.\n\nIn the sidebar under Monetization, click Subscriptions.\n\nClick the subscription group you want to edit.\n\nTo set subscription levels, click Edit Level.\n\nIn the window that opens, click the reordering control on the left of the subscription name and drag it to a new position to change the subscriptions’ level.\n\nClick Save.\n\nAdd localizations\n\nYou can add languages and enter localized metadata for your auto-renewable subscriptions and your subscription groups. For a list of supported languages, visit App Store localizations. Subscription group localizations and subscription localizations are reviewed independently from your in-app purchase submission. For the properties you can localize, visit Required, localizable, and editable properties. For a detailed example visit Localize app information.\n\nImportant: You can manage languages only when the app status is editable.\n\nAdd subscription group localizations\n\nYou can use different subscription group display names and app name display options for each localization. Users will see these names when they manage subscriptions on their devices.\n\nFrom Apps, select your app.\n\nIn the sidebar under Monetization, click Subscriptions.\n\nClick the subscription group name.\n\nClick the add button (+) next to App Store Localizations.\n\nFollow the prompts to select localizations and enter localized subscription group display names and descriptions.\n\nClick Add.\n\nAdd subscription localizations\n\nThe localized display name and description for your subscription will appear on the App Store according to the user’s device language settings.\n\nFrom Apps, select your app.\n\nIn the sidebar under Monetization, click Subscriptions.\n\nClick the subscription group name.\n\nSelect the subscription.\n\nClick the add button (+) next to App Store Localizations.\n\nFollow the prompts to select localizations and enter localized subscription group display names and descriptions.\n\nClick Add.\n\nRelated\nManage pricing for auto-renewable subscriptions\nCreate consumable or non-consumable in-app purchases"

Automatically generated prices account for foreign exchange rates and certain taxes, and follow the most common pricing convention for each country or region.\n\nPeriodically, Apple updates prices in certain regions based on changes in taxes and foreign exchange rates. This is done using publicly available exchange rate information from financial data providers. These automatic price adjustments help ensure that your app’s price across all storefronts stays equalized with your base country or region. Automatic price updates help your global earnings stay consistent, customers aren’t incentivized to seek lower prices on certain storefronts, and pricing mistakes are reduced. Apple will never change the price in your base country or region, and will always notify you in advance of changes on other storefronts.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to manually manage certain storefronts or you can manually manage them all.

    "html": "Configure in-app purchase settings\nOverview for configuring in-app purchases\n\nIn-app purchases let you offer extra content and features in your apps distributed on the App Store — including digital goods, subscriptions, and premium content — directly within your app on all Apple platforms.\n\nNote: It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.\n\nThere are four types of in-app purchases:\n\nType\n\nDescription\n\nConsumable\n\nA product that is used once, after which it becomes depleted and must be purchased again. Example: fish food in a fishing app.\n\nNon-consumable\n\nA product that is purchased once and does not expire or decrease with use. Example: race track for a game app.\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions\n\nA product that allows users to purchase dynamic content for a set period. This type of Subscription renews automatically unless canceled by the user. Example: Monthly subscriptions for an app offering streaming services.\n\nNon-renewing subscriptions\n\nA product that allows users to access content for a limited duration of time. This type of Subscription does not renew automatically. Example: One year subscription to view live gaming content.\n\nYou can create up to 10,000 in-app purchase products per app. Every in-app purchase must be associated with an app and can be shared across multiple platform versions (iOS, macOS, tvOS). In-app purchases can’t be shared across different apps.\n\nImplementing in-app purchases in your app requires configuration between your apps’ server and Apple’s servers, as well as set up and ongoing management in App Store Connect. The following workflow can be used:\n\nAccept the Paid Apps Agreement\n\nTo offer in-app purchases, your membership Account Holder will need to accept the Paid Apps Agreement in the Business section of App Store Connect.\n\nDesign your in-app purchase\n\nTo ensure your in-app purchase experience fits well with the rest of your app and effectively showcases your products, review the Human Interface Guidelines and App Review Guidelines.\n\nConfigure in-app purchases in App Store Connect\n\nCreate in-app purchases and add metadata, such as product name, description, price, and availability. You’ll also need to generate in-app purchase keys and set a tax category, which will allow Apple to calculate the appropriate tax on customer transactions.\n\nImplement StoreKit\n\nAdd the in-app purchase capability to your app in Xcode, making sure that the bundle identifier and product identifiers in Xcode match the identifiers for your app and in-app purchases in App Store Connect.\n\nTest your in-app purchases\n\nApple provides a testing environment, called sandbox, which allows you to test in-app purchases without incurring charges using test accounts. Test each part of your code to verify that you’ve implemented it correctly by using your app to make in-app purchases.\n\nYou can further test your app and in-app purchases using TestFlight, or in Xcode.\n\nUse App Store Server Notifications\n\nApp Store Server Notifications provide near real-time updates about transaction status and key events related to in-app purchases, such as a refund or a change in subscription status or Family Sharing access. To leverage these notifications, you’ll need to enter URLs for your production and sandbox server environments in App Store Connect.\n\nSubmit your in-app purchases for review\n\nBefore you publish your in-app purchase on the App Store it must be submitted for review. If you’re submitting your first in-app purchase, you must submit it with a new version of your app. Make sure you aren't missing any required information before submitting. Monitor in-app purchase statuses to understand if your in-app purchase is available or if it needs your attention.\n\nRelated\nDeveloper Videos\nMarketing In-app purchases\nAuto-renewable subscriptions\nIn-app purchase programming guide"

If payment has been received, the name of your bank and the last four digits of the account will be displayed under the payment amount. The amount displayed is in your bank account currency.\n\nThe date displayed will reflect the date payment was issued. There is also a Transaction ID, a unique seven-digit payment reference number.

If payment hasn’t yet been received for the month you’re viewing, an estimate of your proceeds in your bank account currency will display. This is a consolidated amount owed to you, as of the current date. The actual amount you actually receive may be different. Differences are generally due to changes in the foreign exchange rate by the time of payment, and any applicable withholding tax, which is applied when the payment is made.\n\nEstimated proceeds may display if one of the following has occurred:\n\nExpected Payment Date has not yet occurred.

If you update your Legal Entity Name, the new Legal Entity Name will be assigned a new and unique Vendor Number that is different from the Vendor Number assigned to your old Legal Entity Name. Both Vendor Numbers will be listed so you can view reports for the two legal entities.\n\nYou publish content on Apple News+ or Apple Arcade.

    "html": "Manage compliance information\nManage European Union Digital Services Act trader requirements\n\nArticles 30 and 31 of the Digital Services Act (DSA) require Apple to verify and display trader contact information for all traders distributing apps on the App Store in the European Union (EU). This includes an address, phone number, and email address that you provide to Apple for the purpose of posting on your App Store product page in accordance with the DSA. Once verified, Apple will publish this information on your App Store product page when your app is distributed in any of the 27 territories of the EU.\n\nIf you haven't already confirmed your trader status, next time you submit a new app in App Store Connect you’ll be asked to disclose whether or not you’re a trader in connection with the DSA in order to stay compliant across territories when distributing on the App Store. You'll need to confirm your trader status if you have at least one app on the App Store in the EU that qualifies you as a trader. You’ll then have the option to turn off or specify your trader status for each specific app that you distribute. If you’re not a trader, consumers in the EU will be informed that consumer rights stemming from applicable consumer protection laws won’t apply to contracts between you and them.\n\nTrader self-assessment\n\nYou must assess whether you are a trader for EU law purposes. If you don't distribute apps on the App Store in the EU (e.g. you only distribute apps via alternative distribution, or TestFlight, or on the App Store only outside the EU), you're not acting as a trader on the App Store. Apple can't determine whether you're a trader.\n\nHow to know if you’re a trader\n\nThe DSA defines a trader as “any natural person, or any legal person irrespective of whether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any person acting in his or her name or on his or her behalf, for purposes relating to his or her trade, business, craft or profession.”\n\nThe European Commission (EC) has issued a Notice on what constitutes a trader (See Section 2.2. “Concept of Trader\"), though it is not specific to digital commerce. The EC has also published Guidance in the digital commerce context, from the perspective of when an ”influencer“ may be considered a trader.\n\nTo determine if you're a trader, you should consider a range of non-exhaustive and non-exclusive factors (see those listed on page 2 in the EC’s Guidance), which may include:\n\nWhether you make revenue as a result of your app, for example if your app includes in-app purchases, or if it's a paid or ad-sponsored app — especially if you're transacting in large volumes;\n\nWhether you engage in commercial practices towards consumers, including advertising, or promoting products or services;\n\nWhether you're registered for VAT purposes; and\n\nWhether you develop your app in connection with your trade, business, craft, or profession—meaning that you’re acting in a professional/business capacity. You're unlikely to be a trader for EU law purposes if you're acting “for purposes which are outside your trade, business, craft, or profession.” For example, if you're a hobbyist and you developed your app with no intention of commercializing it, you may not be considered a trader.\n\nRegardless of whether you’re an individual developer or organization, if you have a legal status associated with a business activity, that would suggest you may be a trader.\n\nThe material contained herein is informational, general in nature, and does not constitute legal advice. If you're uncertain about your status as a trader, consult with your legal advisor.\n\nInformation you need to provide if you're a trader\n\nThe information you need to provide depends on whether you’re enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an individual or organization.\n\nOrganizations: The address associated with your D-U-N-S Number will automatically display. You’ll need to enter the following for display on your App Store product pages:\n\nPhone number\n\nEmail address\n\nThis information is for display purposes only and won’t impact the information associated with your Apple Developer Program membership. If you need to update your physical address, contact us.\n\nIndividuals: You’ll need to enter the following for display on your App Store product pages:\n\nAddress or P.O.

Learn more.\n\nProvide banking information in App Store Connect. Payments are sent to the primary bank account on file at the time a payment is processed. Payments to multiple or split bank accounts aren't supported. Learn more.\n\nExceed the minimum monthly payment threshold for each country or region in which you sell content.\n\nComplete any monthly invoicing requirements you’re subject to based on your country or region. Learn more.\n\nIf you meet those requirements, payments are made to the bank account and the currency you provided within 45 days of the last day of the fiscal month in which the transaction was completed.\n\nAll payments are made by direct deposit or electronic funds transfer (EFT.) Note that when available, payments are sent via a low-value transfer as opposed to a high-value wire transfer. Apple's bank will consolidate proceeds for each currency in which you have sales on the App Store, resulting in a single payment to your bank each fiscal month. Payments may be subject to bank fees and transaction costs charged by your bank or intermediate financial institutions, reducing the amount that's deposited in your bank account.\n\nUse the Payments and Financial Reports section of App Store Connect to view your payments owed, amounts paid to you, exchange rates applied, and more. You can also download financial reports, which are made available for the previous fiscal month’s earnings by the first Friday of the current fiscal month.\n\nFinancial reports show payments made to you based on closed transactions and finalized proceeds using the Apple fiscal calendar. Reports only include paid transactions where we are able to collect payment from the customer (view Schedule 2 of your Apple Developer Agreement).\n\nWhat is the exchange rate applied to my payments?\n\nOur bank converts payment amounts into the currency of your bank account. The exchange rate is established by our bank and, due to Apple's volume, is generally a more favorable rate than used by your local bank. The rates are typically the spot rate on the date of payment and no more than three business days prior to the date the proceeds are received into your account.\n\nWhy am I not receiving financial report notifications?\n\nIf financial reports are available for your account and you have not been receiving the related email notifications, confirm that your user profile is set up to receive financial report notifications. If these items are set up correctly, check your email client and/or spam filter to make sure the email address do-not-reply@apple.com is not being blocked.\n\nAdditional information\n\nIf you have a Nepal-based bank account, your payments from Apple will be subject to a 1% advance income tax, deducted from your payment by the local correspondent bank and settled with the local tax authority in Nepal. Apple is not responsible for deducting or remitting this tax to the local tax authority.\n\nRelated\nView and edit your profile"

    "title": "Overview of app transfer - Transfer an app - App Store Connect - Help - Apple Developer",
    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/overview-of-app-transfer",
    "html": "Transfer an app\nOverview of app transfer\n\nYou’ll need to transfer the ownership of an app when you’ve sold the app to another developer or you want to move it to another App Store Connect account or organization.\n\nYou can complete the transfer while keeping the app available for download. The app retains its App Store reviews and ratings during and after the transfer, and users continue to have access to future updates. When an app is transferred it maintains its Bundle ID, which can’t be changed once a build has been uploaded for the app.\n\n1: Verify that the app can be transferred\n\nThe app must meet all app transfer criteria to be transferable.\n\n2: Back up all app information\n\nBecause an app is removed from your account after an app transfer, you should back up all information about the app before you transfer it.\n\n3: Initiate the app transfer\n\nYour membership Account Holder initiates the app transfer. Learn more.\n\n4: Accept the app transfer\n\nThe receiving Account Holder accepts the app transfer. Learn more.\n\nApps using auto-renewable subscriptions\n\nApps that offer auto-renewable subscriptions must use an app-specific shared secret.\n\nInitiate an app transfer\n\nBefore initiating a transfer for an app that offers auto-renewable subscriptions, generate an app-specific shared secret. Then, share the code with the user of the developer account you are transferring the app to. After sharing the code, initiate the app transfer.\n\nAccept an app transfer\n\nBefore you accept an app transfer for an app that offers auto-renewable subscriptions, obtain the app-specific shared secret from the initiator, so that you can update your servers to use the code to verify auto-renewable subscriptions. Once the app transfer is complete, generate an app-specific shared secret so that users outside of your organization no longer have access to it.\n\nApps using keychain sharing\n\nKeychain sharing continues to work only until the app is updated. Therefore, the keychain needs to be rebuilt when submitting an update. If the keychain group is defined in the Xcode project, it must be replaced with a keychain group created by the recipient (that includes the recipient's Team ID) for the app to continue using keychain sharing. After users update their app, it will not find an authentication token in the keychain and will ask for a one-time re-login.\n\nApps using push notifications\n\nAssociated client SSL certificates, TLS certificates, and authentication tokens for push notifications aren’t transferred. If the app uses Apple Push Notifications service (APNs), the recipient needs to create a client SSL certificate using the recipient’s developer account to reenable it.\n\nApps using Apple Pay\n\nIf you transfer an app that uses Apple Pay, the merchant ID is not transferred along with the app. Transactions continue to be successful as long as the original certificates are valid. However, when you submit an update, a new merchant ID must be created on the recipient’s account.\n\nApps using Sign in with Apple\n\nAs part of preparing your data for the recipient before the transfer, you will need to generate a transfer identifier for each user in your database. You can do this via a REST service endpoint provided by Apple.\n\nIf you have grouped your apps for Sign in with Apple, you will need to ungroup them before initiating the transfer.\n\nThe Services ID associated with an app that has configured Sign in with Apple will also be transferred. If you don’t want the Service ID to be transferred, remove its association before initiating the transfer.\n\nApps created with Mac Catalyst\n\nTo transfer apps created with Mac Catalyst that don’t offer universal purchase, both the iPad app (primary app ID) and the Mac app (Mac Catalyst app ID) need to be transferred.\n\nInitiate the transfer of your iPad app first, and then the associated Mac app. It’s important to transfer the Mac app as well, as the transfer recipient won’t be able to use Mac Catalyst to create a new Mac app based on the iPad app.\n\nApps using Wallet\n\nIf your app distributes Wallet passes that require ongoing updates from your app or web service, the passes will eventually need to be reissued using a new identifier after transfer is complete so they can be signed with certificates issued from your Apple Developer account. To minimize user confusion and avoid interruption, we recommend providing a message in your app to let users know that their previously issued pass will become inactive and to download a new pass from your app or web service.\n\nLearn about distributing, updating, and accepting passes.\n\nLearn about best practices for setting alerts.\n\nApps using iCloud\n\nIf your app uses any of the following, it will be transferred to the transfer recipient after they accept the app transfer.\n\niCloud to store user data\n\niCloud containers\n\nKVS identifiers associated with the app\n\nIf multiple apps on your account share a CloudKit container, the transfer of one app will disable the other apps’ ability to read or store data using the transferred CloudKit container. Additionally, the transferor will no longer have access to user data for the transferred app via the iCloud dashboard. Any app updates will disable the app’s ability to read or store data using the transferred CloudKit container.\n\nIf your app uses iCloud Key-Value Storage (KVS), the full KVS value will be embedded in any new provisioning profiles you create for the transferred app. Update your entitlements plist with the full KVS value in your provisioning profile.\n\nLearn about building apps using CloudKit.\n\nApps using Game Center and Apple Arcade\n\nMultiplayer Compatibility: Apps that are part of a cross-app multiplayer compatibility matrix are no longer compatible with or appear in the other app’s matrix. After the app transfer, the recipient must add multiplayer compatibility to the app in order for it to work with their existing apps.\n\nGame Center Groups: Apps that are part of a Game Center group are removed from the group during the transfer. After the transfer, all leaderboards and achievements revert to their original status. Leaderboards that were originally a group leaderboard retain the grp. prefix in their identifier. After the transfer is complete, the recipient can add the app to the Game Center groups.\n\nMerged Leaderboards: Leaderboards that were originally single leaderboards but were merged into a group lose the grp.prefix after transfer. They also revert to the original leaderboard IDs they had before the merge. After the app transfer, the recipient must update the app build with the new leaderboard IDs so that scores post correctly.\n\nMatchmaking: Matchmaking configuration isn’t transferred along with the app. For Game Center matchmaking to work, matchmaking rules must be created or modified on the recipient’s side after transfer is complete.\n\nApps distributed on alternative app marketplaces\n\nBefore initiating a transfer, the transferor should notify any impacted alternative app marketplaces about the transfer of the app. Both the transferor and recipient are responsible for notifying marketplaces of any changes.\n\nIf you’re transferring an app that’s distributed on an alternative app marketplace, the recipient must have the same marketplace added in App Store Connect before the transfer and have signed the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU for the app to remain available for download. Transferred apps will only be available on alternative app marketplaces that were added in App Store Connect by both the transferor and recipient before the transfer.\n\nApp bundles\n\nWhen you transfer an app that is part of an app bundle, you can no longer view your app bundle’s history. It is important to make a record of your app bundle information before you transfer the app.\n\nWhat happens during and after an app transfer\n\nAfter an app is transferred, its associated App ID is also transferred to the recipient’s developer account. If the transferor’s App ID was a wildcard App ID, it’s converted to an explicit App ID that exactly matches the app’s bundle ID.\n\nThe transferor is responsible for exchanging the actual code set and building assets directly with the recipient. Be sure to inform the recipient about any capabilities or App Store configuration added to the app, such as keychain sharing, Game Center, or push notifications, so these are maintained in future updates.\n\nKeep in mind that regardless of app ownership status, new or additional promo codes do not become available after an app has been transferred. Only 100 promo codes can be generated per app version, and are valid for four weeks from the day they are generated.\n\nData for Sales and Trends and Payments and Financial Reports\n\nIf you transfer your app, you will continue to have access to information for payments and sales that occurred prior to the transfer. You will not be able to access information for sales after the transfer has been completed. The recipient of the transferred app will only receive payment and sales information for transactions that occurred after the transfer.\n\nData for App Analytics\n\nWhen you transfer an app from your account to someone else, you will no longer have access to the app's data in App Analytics. You can find the historical data of the app in Sales and Trends. If someone transfers an app to you, you'll get access to all analytics data as of April 1, 2015, or since the app was first made available on the App Store, whichever occurred later.\n\nRelated\nApp transfer criteria\nInitiate an app transfer\nAccept an app transfer"

    "html": "View App Analytics\nView product page optimization results\n\nProduct page optimization helps you evaluate which version of your product page is most effective at getting users to download your app. These tests use a range of modern and rigorous Bayesian techniques and require minimal overhead to launch a test, transparently communicate changing results as they arrive, and identify the best version as quickly as possible. This methodology is designed by Apple specifically for App Store product page data, so you can evaluate results every day with the confidence that you’re receiving the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nOnce a test gathers enough impressions for 90% confidence, a treatment may be marked as Performing Better or Performing Worse, compared to your chosen baseline. (This baseline is the original product page by default, and can be changed to a treatment at any time.) The main measure of performance for each product page version is the conversion rate — the estimated percentage of users that downloaded or pre-ordered your app after viewing the product page. If the amount of data required to reach a high confidence level is more than you’ll likely receive based on your test’s traffic partway through the test, we’ll let you know that your test may be inconclusive.\n\nYour test results will indicate an estimated conversion rate for each variant, an estimated lift in conversion between variants, and Apple’s level of confidence in the results. To calculate this data, Apple takes into account a range of prior information about the performance of your app’s product page. This helps ensure that there’s enough data to report on a difference between your variants.\n\nRequired role: Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales.

    "url": "https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/view-app-analytics/view-peer-group-benchmarks",
    "html": "View App Analytics\nView peer group benchmarks\n\nPeer group benchmarks help you put your app’s performance into context by comparing your results to those of apps that are similar to yours.\n\nYou can view peer group benchmarks across several key metrics, including conversion rate, day 1, day 7, and day 28 retention rates, crash rate, and average proceeds per paying user. Peer group benchmark metrics are defined in the same way as the the standard app metrics in App Analytics and are displayed in weekly intervals.\n\nPeer groups are created using a number of different attributes to help ensure you can compare your app’s performance to the most relevant benchmark:\n\nApp Store category\n\nApps in the same App Store category are grouped together in the same peer group. Apps that belong to multiple categories, such as primary and secondary categories, will be included in each category when calculating the respective benchmarks. You’ll be able to view benchmarks for each App Store category you belong to, as long as there are enough apps in that peer group to ensure individual app performance is protected, and your app won’t be included in a category that you haven’t assigned to your app. You can view which App Store categories your app is included in by reviewing your app information in App Store Connect.\n\nApp Store business model\n\nApps with the same business model are grouped together in the same peer group. The available business models are free, freemium, paid, paymium, and subscriptions. Apps with in-app purchases are considered freemium or paymium. Apps that have an associated cost to download are considered paid or paymium. In order to be considered part of the subscription business model, a freemium or paymium app must generate at least 50% of its revenue from auto-renewable subscriptions. An app’s business model assignment will only switch between the freemium and subscription business models after the app has belonged to the new business model for three consecutive weeks. Other business model changes, such as from free to paid, will occur immediately.\n\nApp Store download volume\n\nApps with similar levels of download volume in a given week are grouped together into low download volume, medium download volume, and high download volume peer groups. Apps are placed into these groups based on the number of first-time downloads and redownloads they have compared to the rest of the apps in the peer group. Download volume is determined relative to the rest of your peer group, so it’s possible for your app to appear in different volume tiers for different peer groups. You can toggle between these peer groups after you click into the detailed view for a specific metric on the Benchmarks tab.\n\nLearn how to take action on insights from peer group benchmarks.\n\nRequired role: Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales. View role permissions.\n\nView app benchmark data\n\nFrom App Analytics, select your app.\n\nClick the Benchmarks tab to open the Benchmarks overview page, and compare your app’s performance across a variety of metrics.\n\nAvailable benchmark metrics include download conversion rate, proceeds per paying user, crash rate, and retention metrics. In each metric widget, you can view how your app compares to your peer group’s 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values.\n\nBy default, the peer groups for your app’s primary App Store category and business model appear. Data will display from the most recent week during which benchmarks were available. If your app has a subcategory or secondary category, you can view these peer groups by clicking the peer group name. To view data for apps in all categories using the same business model as yours, select All Categories.\n\nIn some cases, your assigned peer group may not be big enough to display a benchmark. Use the category menu to select a different peer group in these cases. Keep in mind that if your app is a free app, you won’t see a benchmark for proceeds per paying user.\n\nClick View Trends next to any of the performance metrics to open a detailed view containing a graph that illustrates your app’s performance over time. You can view a more granular peer group by further refining the data by app download volume.\n\nThe detailed view opens with the last 26 weeks displayed by default. Click the date picker to select a different date range.\n\nNext to Compare To, select a peer group percentile to compare your app against a different percentile value. This returns a dotted line on the graph to illustrate the performance of your peer group's apps compared to yours.\n\nHow does Apple protect the privacy of individual apps in each peer group?\n\nPeer group benchmark values are calculated using a technique called differential privacy, which is the gold standard for ensuring that aggregated data remains both helpful and private. Apple displays peer group metrics only when the number of apps in the group meets a minimum threshold, and after we add a certain amount of noise to each data point. The amount of noise added is inversely proportional to the number of apps in the group, which ensures that we maintain a minimum amount of privacy for each group.\n\nWhy does App Analytics display benchmarks for a particular week, but not others?\n\nThere are several reasons why benchmark data might show for one week and not another:\n\nPeer groups need a minimum number of apps in order to show data in a way that preserves privacy. If the number of apps in the peer group drops below the minimum threshold, data won’t appear for the week.\n\nDay 28 retention takes longer to calculate than other metrics since it’s a longer duration. When selecting a recent weekly date range, day 28 retention data won’t appear.\n\nYour app has a new category or business model, and you selected the previous peer group. The trend line stops when your app switches to a new peer group.\n\nWhy does App Analytics display benchmarks for a particular metric, but not others?\n\nSome apps will display data from a different number of benchmarks compared to others. One reason for this is that developers can only view benchmarks for peer groups that are relevant for them. For example, free apps won’t display a proceeds per paying user benchmark, and Arcade apps will only display crash rate benchmarks in order to avoid showing unhelpful comparisons.\n\nAdditionally, a benchmark won’t be shown if it doesn’t meet the privacy threshold. For example, if your app uses a lesser-used business model, such as paid or paidmium, your benchmarks may not all meet the privacy threshold and, as a result, you may observe fewer benchmarks.\n\nCan I change my peer group?\n\nIn most cases, yes.\n\nCategory: If you switch your App Store category, then your peer group comparison will change. You’ll be able to view benchmarks for each App Store category you belong to, as long as there are enough apps in that peer group to ensure individual app performance is protected. If you switch App Store categories, you’ll maintain the ability to access historical benchmark data for the time you were in that category, but you won’t be able to view new benchmark data for that category. You’ll be able to view benchmark data for your new category starting from the week you switched.\n\nBusiness model: You can change which business model you’ll be compared against by updating your app’s metadata. If you have in-app purchases in your metadata, you’ll be considered freemium or paymium. If you don’t have any in-app purchases and offer your app for free, you’ll be considered free. In order to be considered part of the subscription business model, your app must generate at least 50% of its revenue from auto-renewable subscriptions. Both free and paid apps can be subscription apps.\n\nDownload volume: Apps are placed into download volume buckets based on the number of first-time downloads and redownloads they have when compared to the rest of the apps in their peer group. As a result, you cannot manually change which download volume bucket your app is in. However, App Analytics lets you view peer group benchmarks for any download volume group you want, so you can easily determine what your benchmark would be if you received more or fewer downloads in the future.\n\nHow will benchmark data be impacted if I change my app’s category or business model?\n\nApp Analytics detects when you change your app’s category or business model and automatically switches your app to the new peer group. You’ll continue to have access to historical benchmark data for the previous groups you belonged to, and subsequent weeks will show the data from your new peer group. An annotation will appear in the benchmark trends chart when your peer group changes.\n\nWhat benchmark data is available for Apple Arcade games?\n\nApple Arcade games are included in the paid business model peer group and benchmark data is only available for the crash rate metric.\n\nRelated\nWatch “Discover benchmarks in App Analytics”\nLearn how to take action on insights from benchmarks\nWatch “Measure and improve acquisition with App Analytics”"

When your app is available for pre-order, customers can view your product page and order your app before it's released for download.\n\nEligibility\n\nYou can offer your app for pre-order in any country or region on the App Store where the app hasn't already been released.\n\nFree and paid apps on all Apple platforms are eligible to offer pre-orders. In-app purchases aren’t eligible for pre-order, but you can set up your in-app purchases, including promotional metadata, in App Store Connect before and during the pre-order period so that everything is ready once your app is released for download. Promoted in-app purchases don’t display on your App Store product page until your app is released for download.\n\nApp bundles cannot be made available for pre-order. Apps that are offered for pre-order must have at least one country or region where the app is already Ready for Sale in order to be added to a new app bundle.\n\nCustomer experience\n\nPre-orders can be made on devices running iOS 11.2, iPadOS 13, tvOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and watchOS 6, or later. During pre-order, product pages are accessible to customers using earlier operating systems through direct links. However, the Buy button is disabled and customers are prompted to update to the latest OS version to pre-order apps.\n\nCustomers can cancel their pre-orders in their App Store settings on iOS and macOS, and in their iTunes settings on a PC. Learn more.\n\nIf your pre-order’s release date is less than 180 days from today, the complete release date will display on your app’s product page (for example: “Expected Jan 1, 2024”). If your release date is more than 180 days from today, only the month and year of the app’s release date will display (for example: “Expected Jan 2024”).\n\nCustomers who pre-order a paid app won’t be charged until the day the app is released for download. You may adjust the price of your app during the pre-order period, but keep in mind that if you change pricing, customers will be charged the lower price — either the price they accepted for pre-order or the price on the day of release.\n\nOnce your app is released, customers are notified and your app automatically downloads on the device on which they made the pre-order.

To publish your app, choose which build to submit to review.\n\nStep 2: Set pricing and availability for the App Store\n\nYou must set a price and tax category for your app. Although your app is available in all App Store localizations by default, you can select specific regions for your app instead. You also have the option to publish your app for pre-order.\n\nStep 3: Submit your app for review\n\nYou submit your app for review to start the App Review process and to make your app available on the App Store. Before you submit an app, enter all the required metadata and choose if you want to release your app manually or automatically, or if you want to release your app in phases.\n\nStep 4: View your app status and resolve review issues\n\nAfter you submit your app, the app status changes to Waiting for Review. If there are any issues with your app, read and reply to App Review communications. After your app is approved, it can take up to 24 hours to go live on the App Store.\n\nStep 5: Request promo codes for the App Store\n\nAfter your app is approved, you can request promo codes to distribute to users before you make your app available on the App Store. You can distribute the promo codes by email or other means, and the user enters the promo code when purchasing the app from the App Store.\n\nRelated\nPricing and availability\nApp Store localizations"

Learn more.\n\nMake improvements to your app and continue distributing builds until all issues are resolved before you submit your app for review.\n\nYour macOS apps must be built with Xcode 13 or later to use TestFlight for Mac. If your app includes an App Clip, you can invite testers to test the App Clip experience on its own. Testers who are invited to test your app can test both the app and the App Clip. Either the app or the App Clip can be installed on a device at a time, and testers can choose to switch between the two at any time.\n\nLearn how to manage beta testing with the App Store Connect API.\n\nStep 1: Enter test information\n\nEnter test information about your app, such as a beta app description, an explanation of features to test, and an email address that accepts feedback.\n\nStep 2: Upload your build\n\nUpload your build to App Store Connect. Read Cryptography and U.S. export compliance to determine if you need to provide app encryption documentation for your app. You can test a build for up to 90 days.\n\nNote: Builds with provisioning profiles must contain application identifiers in order to be eligible for TestFlight.\n\nStep 3: Invite internal and external testers\n\nCreate groups for testers, then assign specific builds to them. After you've added builds to a group, you can add external testers (up to 10,000 people) and internal testers (up to 100 App Store Connect users with access to your content) to test your app. If you invite external testers, your beta build may require review. When you add the first build of your app to a group, the build gets sent to App Review to make sure it follows the App Review Guidelines. A review is only required for the first build of a version and subsequent builds may not need a full review. Testing can begin once a build is approved.\n\nNote: Managed Apple IDs can’t be used to test builds.\n\nStep 4: Testers download TestFlight and accept your invitations\n\nTesters install the free TestFlight app on their devices. Then they use their invitation email or a public link to accept invitations, install your app, send feedback, and get updates. Testers download and install thinned variants of your app.\n\nStep 5: View tester and build information\n\nTrack tester engagement and your app’s performance by viewing build status and metrics, such as number of sessions and crashes. You can also resend email invitations to testers who haven't accepted their invitation.\n\nStep 6: Collect feedback from testers\n\nTesters running TestFlight for TestFlight 2.3 or later can send feedback through the TestFlight app or directly from your beta app by taking a screenshot. This feature is also available in TestFlight for Mac and Apple Vision Pro. You can view this tester feedback in the TestFlight Feedback section in App Store Connect. Testers running tvOS or earlier versions of iOS can send feedback to the email address you specified in step 1.\n\nStep 7: Stop testing\n\nWhen testing is done, you can optionally expire a build to stop testing it. If you don’t expire your build and submit it to the App Store, testers that received an invitation to test will still be able to test your build even after it goes live on the App Store. Your build will become unavailable for testers after 90 days.\n\nRelated\nUpload builds\nOverview of publishing your app on the App Store\nSubmit for review\nGet started with TestFlight"

The U.S. Government defines \"non-standard cryptography\" as any implementation of “cryptography” involving the incorporation or use of proprietary or unpublished cryptographic functionality, including encryption algorithms or protocols that have not been adopted or approved by a duly recognized international standards body (e.g., IEEE, IETF, ISO, ITU, ETSI, 3GPP, TIA, and GSMA) and have not otherwise been published.\n\nPlease note that it’s your responsibility to review the Export Administration Regulation to determine if your app’s use of encryption requires a formal classification (Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System or CCATS) from BIS. All liabilities associated with misinterpretation of export regulations or claiming exemption inaccurately are your responsibility. To learn about encryption export controls, search for “encryption policy” on the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) website. The import and export of encryption apps distributed in France are also controlled by the Government of France. The main items of control for France are Secure Storage, Secure Communications, and Security Anti-Virus applications. Exemptions include Banking and Medical applications. For more information about these French controls, visit the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI) website.\n\nWhen you submit a new version of your app, you’ll need to answer questions in App Store Connect about your app's use of encryption. Follow the steps below before submitting your app to App Review to ensure that you’re submitting the right documentation and to bypass these questions if your app doesn’t use encryption.\n\nDetermine your export compliance requirements\n\nApp Store Connect provides a simple way for you to determine your export compliance requirements by presenting you with a set of questions about your app and where you plan to make it available. Complete the following next steps based on the results of your answers:\n\nScenario\n\nNext Steps\n\nNo export compliance documentation required\n\nUpdate your app’s information property list (Info.plist) file in Xcode so that you don’t need to answer encryption questions with each app submission.\n\nExport compliance documentation required\n\nUse App Store Connect to submit your app encryption documentation.\nOnce the documentation is approved, attach it to your beta build or app version build.\nUpdate your app’s information property list (Info.plist) file in Xcode so that you don’t need to answer encryption questions with each app submission."

You can verify a build’s device requirements on the Build Metadata page.\n\nThe Minimum iOS Version is the MinimumOSVersion provided in your build.\n\nThe Minimum macOS Version is the minimum version of macOS required for your app to run, as determined by Apple.\n\nApple automatically calculates the minimum macOS version using the LSMinimumSystemVersion provided in your build, if applicable, and the closest related macOS for the MinimumOSVersion provided in your build. If you’ve selected a minimum macOS version in Pricing and Availability and the value is higher than the LSMinimumSystemVersion or the closest related macOS for the MinimumOSVersion, this version will be shown instead.\n\nThe LS Minimum System Version is the optional LSMinimumSystemVersion provided in your build.\n\nDownload dSYM files\n\nIf you include bitcode when you upload your app to App Store Connect, Apple generates debug symbol (dSYM) files, which you’ll need to download in Xcode or App Store Connect before you can view logs in Xcode.\n\nNote: Starting with Xcode 14, bitcode is no longer required for tvOS or watchOS apps, and Apple no longer accepts bitcode submissions from Xcode 14. dSYM files can only be downloaded for existing bitcode submissions and are no longer available for submissions from Xcode 14 or later.\n\nLearn how to analyze crash reports using dSYM files.\n\nTo download dSYM files for a build in App Store Connect:\n\nFrom Apps, select your app.\n\nClick the TestFlight tab to view all builds.\n\nIn the sidebar, select the platform you want to view build metadata for.\n\nNote: Builds are organized by version number.

If you use the App Store Connect API you might want to upload your binary using the Transporter command-line tool and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) authentication. You can use the same JWTs you use for the API to upload your binary. You can upload more builds as your app changes, distribute a build for testing, or submit your app for review.\n\nThe first time you upload a build, a beta version of the app is created in your account. However, the build needs to be processed in Apple’s system before it appears in App Store Connect. You’ll receive an email when this process is complete.\n\nEach time you upload a build, the bundle ID and version number (located in the app bundle) are used to associate the build with the app and version record in App Store Connect. The build string is used to uniquely identify the build throughout the system.\n\nYou can also create and upload your build with Xcode Cloud, which lets you adopt continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), a standard practice that helps you monitor and improve software quality over time while ensuring that your app or framework is always in a releasable state. For details, view Xcode Cloud documentation.\n\nUpload your app binary files with Xcode\n\nXcode is Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE). You use Xcode to build apps for Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, and Apple Watch. Xcode provides tools to manage your entire development workflow — from creating your app to testing, optimizing, and submitting it for review.\n\nTo learn how to upload your app binary using Xcode, visit Upload an app to App Store Connect, or in Xcode, choose Help > Xcode Help and search for “Upload an app.”\n\nDownload Xcode on the Mac App Store.\n\nSupported Xcode Versions\n\nApp Store Connect supports the following versions of Xcode to upload your app for customer distribution or to testers using TestFlight.

App Store Connect API keys are unique to the App Store Connect API and can’t be used for other Apple services.\n\nTo get started, the Account Holder must first request access to the API in App Store Connect.\n\nRequest access to the App Store Connect API\n\nRequired role: Account Holder. View role permissions.\n\nFrom Users and Access, click Integrations. The Page opens with the App Store Connect API selected.\n\nClick Request Access.\n\nSelect the checkbox to agree to the terms, then click Submit.\n\nOnce submitted, your request will be reviewed. Requests are approved on a case by case basis.\n\nGenerate a team API key\n\nRequired role: Account Holder or Admin. View role permissions.\n\nTeam keys can be used across all the apps in your account, or you can assign them to only specific roles.\n\nFrom Users and Access, click Integrations. The page opens with the App Store Connect API selected.\n\nClick Team Keys.\n\nClick Generate API Key. If you already have an Active API key generated, you can click the add button (+) to add more.\n\nEnter a name for the key. The name is used for your reference only and isn’t part of the key itself.\n\nUnder Access, select the role permissions to determine what the API can be used for. Team API keys are applied across all apps, so app access can’t be limited for an API key.\n\nClick Generate.\n\nOnce you generate an API key, you won't be able to edit its name or access level. If you need to make changes, revoke the API key and generate a new one. View details on managing and securing your keys.\n\nGenerate API keys for individual use\n\nRequired role: Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Customer Support, Developer, or Marketing. View role permissions.\n\nAll App Store Connect users can generate and revoke API keys for individual use by default, unless an Admin or Account Holder has revoked their ability to do so. Each user can only have one active API key at a time.\n\nOn the top right of any App Store Connect page, click your user name, then click Edit Profile.\n\nUnder Individual API Key, click Generate Key.\n\nTo download your individual API key, click Download, then click Download in the dialog.\n\nNote: API keys are private and can only be downloaded once. After downloading the key, store it in a safe place. Remember to revoke a key immediately if it becomes lost or compromised.\n\nTo revoke an individual API key, click Revoke, then click Revoke in the dialog. An API key can't be reinstated once it's been revoked.\n\nManage individual and team keys\n\nRequired role: Account Holder or Admin. View role permissions.\n\nUsers with the Account Holder or Admin role can view and manage team keys, and individual keys created by members of their App Store Connect Team. If you no longer want someone to be able to use an API key to authenticate into App Store Connect services, you can revoke that key. To revoke that API key and prevent the user from creating a new one, you can remove 'Generate Individual API Keys' from the user's permissions.\n\nFrom Users and Access, click Integrations. The page opens with the App Store Connect API selected.\n\nOn the top left, click Individual Keys, or Team Keys.\n\nOn the top right, click Edit.\n\nSelect the API Keys you want to revoke.\n\nOn the top right, click Revoke Key, then click Revoke in the dialog.

They can then perform tasks based on the roles you assign them. Learn about roles.\n\nAdd your app and upload a build\n\nIn the Apps section, create an app record so your app’s information, such as name, keywords, and description, is ready for distribution. You don’t need to finish creating your app in Xcode before entering its information in App Store Connect. However, you must create an app record before you can upload a build of your app. You can upload multiple builds, and then view the builds and variants in App Store Connect.\n\nTest and submit your app\n\nDistribute your app for testing using TestFlight, which supports apps for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS. You can add internal testers and invite external testers who'll use the TestFlight app to install your app on their devices. When your app is ready for distribution, choose the build you want to submit and send it to App Review. You can continue improving your app by creating new versions periodically.\n\nMonitor your apps status, usage, and sales\n\nYou can monitor the status of your app as it goes through App Review. Once it’s live on the App Store, you can gain insights on its performance through App Analytics, Sales and Trends, and Payments and Financial Reports, and respond to user reviews on the App Store. App Store Connect for iPhone and iPad also lets you view some of this information and perform other tasks."

If areInIncreasingOrder throws an error during the sort, the elements may be in a different order, but none will be lost.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhen you want to sort a collection of elements that don’t conform to the Comparable protocol, pass a closure to this method that returns true when the first element should be ordered before the second.\n\nIn the following example, the closure provides an ordering for an array of a custom enumeration that describes an HTTP response. The predicate orders errors before successes and sorts the error responses by their error code.\n\nenum HTTPResponse {\n    case ok\n    case error(Int)\n}\n\n\nvar responses: [HTTPResponse] = [.error(500), .ok, .ok, .error(404), .error(403)]\nresponses.sort {\n    switch ($0, $1) {\n    // Order errors by code\n    case let (.error(aCode), .error(bCode)):\n        return aCode < bCode\n\n\n    // All successes are equivalent, so none is before any other\n    case (.ok, .ok): return false\n\n\n    // Order errors before successes\n    case (.error, .ok): return true\n    case (.ok, .error): return false\n    }\n}\nprint(responses)\n// Prints \"[.error(403), .error(404), .error(500), .ok, .ok]\"\n\n\nAlternatively, use this method to sort a collection of elements that do conform to Comparable when you want the sort to be descending instead of ascending. Pass the greater-than operator (>) operator as the predicate.\n\nvar students = [\"Kofi\", \"Abena\", \"Peter\", \"Kweku\", \"Akosua\"]\nstudents.sort(by: >)\nprint(students)\n// Prints \"[\"Peter\", \"Kweku\", \"Kofi\", \"Akosua\", \"Abena\"]\"\n\n\nareInIncreasingOrder must be a strict weak ordering over the elements.

(Transitive comparability)\n\nTwo elements are incomparable if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If a and b are incomparable, and b and c are incomparable, then a and c are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)\n\nThe sorting algorithm is guaranteed to be stable.

This operation isn’t guaranteed to be stable, so the relative ordering of elements within the partitions might change.\n\nIn the following example, an array of numbers is partitioned by a predicate that matches elements greater than 30.\n\nvar numbers = [30, 40, 20, 30, 30, 60, 10]\nlet p = numbers.partition(by: { $0 > 30 })\n// p == 5\n// numbers == [30, 10, 20, 30, 30, 60, 40]\n\n\nThe numbers array is now arranged in two partitions.

If the contiguous storage doesn’t exist, the collection creates it. If the collection doesn’t support an internal representation in the form of contiguous mutable storage, this method doesn’t call body — it immediately returns nil.\n\nThe optimizer can often eliminate bounds- and uniqueness-checking within an algorithm. When that fails, however, invoking the same algorithm on the buffer argument may let you trade safety for speed.\n\nAlways perform any necessary cleanup in the closure, because the method makes no guarantees about the state of the collection if the closure throws an error. Your changes to the collection may be absent from the collection after throwing the error, because the closure could receive a temporary copy rather than direct access to the collection’s storage.\n\nWarning\n\nYour body closure must not replace buffer. This leads to a crash in all implementations of this method within the standard library.\n\nSuccessive calls to this method may provide a different pointer on each call. Don’t store buffer outside of this method.\n\nA Collection that provides its own implementation of this method must provide contiguous storage to its elements in the same order as they appear in the collection.

If transform throws an error, the sequence ends.\n\nReturn Value\n\nAn asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the non-nil elements produced by the transform closure. The sequence ends either when the base sequence ends or when transform throws an error.\n\nDiscussion\n\nUse the compactMap(_:) method to transform every element received from a base asynchronous sequence, while also discarding any nil results from the closure. Typically, you use this to transform from one type of element to another.\n\nIn this example, an asynchronous sequence called Counter produces Int values from 1 to 5. The closure provided to the compactMap(_:) method takes each Int and looks up a corresponding String from a romanNumeralDict dictionary. Since there is no key for 4, the closure returns nil in this case, which compactMap(_:) omits from the transformed asynchronous sequence. When the value is 5, the closure throws MyError, terminating the sequence.\n\nlet romanNumeralDict: [Int: String] =\n    [1: \"I\", 2: \"II\", 3: \"III\", 5: \"V\"]\n\n\ndo {\n    let stream = Counter(howHigh: 5)\n        .compactMap { (value) throws -> String? in\n            if value == 5 {\n                throw MyError()\n            }\n            return romanNumeralDict[value]\n        }\n    for try await numeral in stream {\n        print(numeral, terminator: \" \")\n    }\n} catch {\n    print(\"Error: \\(error)\")\n}\n// Prints \"I II III Error: MyError() \"\n"

That is, for any elements a, b, and c, the following conditions must hold:\n\nareInIncreasingOrder(a, a) is always false. (Irreflexivity)\n\nIf areInIncreasingOrder(a, b) and areInIncreasingOrder(b, c) are both true, then areInIncreasingOrder(a, c) is also true. (Transitive comparability)\n\nTwo elements are incomparable if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If a and b are incomparable, and b and c are incomparable, then a and c are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)\n\nThe following example uses an enumeration of playing cards ranks, Rank, which ranges from ace (low) to king (high). An asynchronous sequence called RankCounter produces all elements of the array. The predicate provided to the min(by:) method sorts ranks based on their rawValue:\n\nenum Rank: Int {\n    case ace = 1, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king\n}\n\n\nlet min = await RankCounter()\n    .min { $0.rawValue < $1.rawValue }\nprint(min ?? \"none\")\n// Prints \"ace\"\n"

The bundle identifier for the project has an associated App ID, so you need a unique identifier to create your own App ID. Use a reverse-DNS format for your identifier, as Preparing your app for distribution describes.\n\nIn Safari, visit the Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles section of the Apple Developer website.\n\nSelect Identifiers, and click the Add button to create a new App ID for MusicMarathon. Follow the steps until you reach the Register an App ID page.\n\nFor the Bundle ID, select Explicit, and enter the bundle ID from step 2.\n\nClick the App Services tab, and select the MusicKit checkbox.\n\nComplete the App ID creation process.\n\nAfter creating your App ID, your Xcode project needs no additional configuration.

The bundle identifier within the project has an associated App ID, so you need a unique identifier to create your own App ID.

Follow the steps until you reach the Register an App ID page.\n\nFor the Bundle ID, select Explicit, and enter the bundle identifier from step 2.\n\nClick the App Services tab, and select the MusicKit checkbox.\n\nComplete the App ID creation process.\n\nAfter creating your App ID, your Xcode project needs no additional configuration.

    "html": "Overview\n\nUse MusicKit to integrate your app with Apple Music API, a web service you use to access information about music items in the Apple Music catalog. Using MusicKit, you can more easily build apps that tie into Apple Music.\n\nThe framework provides a model layer for accessing music items in Swift, as well as playback support so you can add music to your app. Additionally, it provides some related user interface elements, such as a view to display images that correspond to artwork for a music item, or a way to present music subscription offers to users who may not have an active Apple Music subscription.\n\nImportant\n\nUsers must grant permission for your app to access their music data. Add the NSAppleMusicUsageDescription key to your app’s Info.plist file, and include a description of how you intend to use the user’s media. If this key isn’t present, the system terminates your app when it tries to access the user’s music.\n\nRequest permission for your app to use MusicKit with MusicAuthorization. Check specific capabilities for the current MusicSubscription to ensure your music-related functionality is available to the user. Find music items using a search term with MusicCatalogSearchRequest, or find music items using a filter with MusicCatalogResourceRequest. Play music in your app with one of the two music players that MusicKit offers.
